decresse, he thinks, may be owing to a slight refrigeratione of elimate r hut, as
the climate is rather improved, and the spirit of plauting become more general,
this, he thinlrs, may give encouragement to more extended lanting of the
chestnut. There is one circumstance, he says, connected with the timber of
the chestnut, in Scotland, which mrut prevent its general arse in stip-building;
and thetis, that few trees of it of any siae are found without the timber being
shaky or split; some to such a degree, that the annual rings, or conceutric
growths, have separated from each other. Mr. Mathew, who is evidently an
original observes, though, in this case, he has mixed up facts that have come
under his own observatiou with the current opinion respecting the use of
chestnut timber iu old buildings, and in the Spauish navy, remarks, with Bosc,
that the timber, though a good deal similar to that of the oak, is not “quite
so reedy and classic, but is destitute of the large laurinae, οτ platesfflosh),
which, radiating from the ith to the outside, become so ruminent to view in
the oak, when tlre lo 'tuchoni rectiori is parallel to the· phane of the laminae.” v
(Nae. iim.. pli.) ehave quoted these drlferentoprurons, for the purpose
of showing that the ground ou which British authors hitherto have recom-
mended the culture of the chestnut aa timber is the erroneous supposition
that the roofs of many ofour sacient buildings are formed of it ; aud that, on
the faith of this, Evelyu, and others of them, appear ιο havesrguedin its
favour, contrary to theu· own experience.

The following remarks on the propertics and uses of the chestnut by Μτ.
Nathanicl Keut, awell-lrnowu and highly respected land aud timber survcyor,
are dated 1799, and were published in the tenth volume of the alammion
qs the Society of Ατιτ. They seem to us'to contain all that can be said, from
practical experiente, in favour of the chestnut as a timber trae in Britain. ‘⁴ ln
1676,” Μτ. Kcnt observes, “ an ancestor of the present Μτ. Windham of
Felbrigg‚ iu Norfollr, had the merit of bein a considerable planter of chestnut.
In the space of 50 years, it is presumed, ese plantations required thinning,
aa his successor, about that time, began to apply this timber to useful purposea
upon his estate. Thefirst account is of the branch or limb of o chestnut,about
lssin. square, which, in the year 1726, was put down as a hanging-post fora
gete, and carried the te, without alteration, 52 years3 when, upon altering
the enclosures of the arm where it stood, it vas talren up under my direction,
and appeariug to be perfectly sound, was put down for a clappmg-post in

first the barn was built. About the same time, several chestuut posta and rails
were put down,which 1 have since seen removed; and, alter standing 30 or 40
years, they generali appeared so sound, aa to admit of bciug set rrp in some
other place. The dar instance Ι shall mention, tho h not of long date, will
show the grem su riority of this timber over oak iu 'encea In the year 1772,
the present Μτ. indham made a lar plantation in his park, which was
fenced with sts and rails, converted rom young oalrs and chestnuts of the
same age an acantliug, such aa were pickerl out of a place where they stood
too thiclr. Lost year, upon Mr. Windhsm's enlarging this plantation, it was
necessary to remove this feuce3 when tlte chestnut posta were found as souud

the surface of the ground, that they could not bc used for the same purpose
