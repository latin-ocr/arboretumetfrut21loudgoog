sery lines sor at least one year before removal ιο their final situation. The
tree is admirably adaptedsor thickening or filling up blanks in woods and
plantations; and, for this pu , se, truncheona may be planted 3in. or lin. in
diameter, and lost. or 12 ft. igh. These truncheons heve the great adran-
tage ol not being overshadoved by the adjoining trees, which is almost always
the case when young plants ere used for filling up vacancies among old trees.
The truncheons need nothe inserted ver deeply ιιι the soil, because the roots
which they prounde, like those of all ο er trees having creeping rocta, ori·
ginme iu apert of the trunlr near the suriaco. When the white poplar is
planted in messes, with a view to produce timber, the planta ought to be srom
left. to 18 e. apart every way, and they may be most profitably cut down
at the end οι 30 οι 40 years; but, when they are only to produce poles of
from 6in. ιο 9iu. in diameter, fit sor roo sheds and similar urpuses, they
need nothe planted at a greater distance t en srom tlt. to eh. every way,

and, for copphrce wood, from ast to eft is the proper distance. Owing ιο the

softness of t e wood, andita liability to shrinlr and crach, it is dangerous to
cut off very large branches3 and, even when branches of moderate size are
cut off, the wonnd ο ht always ιο bc covered over with grahing clay, or
