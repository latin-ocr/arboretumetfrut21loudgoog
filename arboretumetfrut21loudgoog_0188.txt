noeroil, when the tree is grown in cdcsreous soils, or amonsg caleareous

rocks: in ι ιιι-ιοιιοιοιι soil, whatever may be the character ο ιιι suriace,
it will not thrive. The walnnt is not a social tree, and neither produces good
timber nor fruit when lanted in ιιιιιιιι. Βοιι on the Continentand in
England, it succwds well ss sn avenne or rond-side trec, and it forms ιιι
excellent shelter lor orchards and kitchen-gardens, when planted at such a

and in Eugland, is commonly knoclred down from the tree by tlarashing
the extremities os the branches (on which alone it is produced) with
long poles. By thrs process, Μι. Rogers observes, “many os the points
ol the branehes ιιι broken, which causes the productiori ol many spur·
like sboots, that afterwards bear flowers and fruit. Hence the custom
of beating s berren tree ιο ιιιιι it bear.” (M eutr.. p. 380.) Bosc con·
sidera that hosting down the huit with poles is injurious to the tree; but,
in France, he adds, as the trees ιιι not in enclosures, this barbarons practice
is altogether unsvoidable. If the trees were enclosed, be continues, or is pro·
perty exposed by the road sides were sufficiently respected, it would be unne-
cesssry to beet down the nuts at all,as the wind alone, when the imit is com-

letely matured, would be quite sufficient to detach it from the tree. This
ιιι suggested ιο us the ides οι· using long rods, with a contrivance at their
extremities lor taking fust hold of the branches, so ss to admit ol ebeling
them powerfully, and thus obtaining by nrt ιιι effect osa violent wind. ln
gatlrering up the iniit which has been either beaten down,or fallen nanually,
those nuta which have separated from the huslts ιιι kept by themselves, taken
home, and spread out on a boarded lloor in an airy shed or granary, to the
depth ol 3rn. Here they ιιι turned over daily, till they mcomepcrfectly

placed in little heaps on the ound, but still under cover3 and turned over,
and gently beaten‚till tlte hu separares. ln Frsnce care is taken to prevent
these heaps from fermentin or sweating, as itis called; because thet occs-
sions s change in the kernei, and gives a teste to the oil. When the nuts hene
been thoroughly dried, those not wanted to crush for oil are laid by, oren ιιι

stmosphere; in which state they will retain all their good qualities l'or about
twelve months. ln Britain, the nuts ol the walnnt may be preserved beahand

Walnuts, Rogers observes, should not be gadtered till the outer covering parts
readily from the shell, which is belore that coverin becomes meuly. There is
a critical timeat which the oovoehrg leaves the sb without staining it, which
it isapt to do if allowed to remain on till it becomes solt. Alter being shelled,
