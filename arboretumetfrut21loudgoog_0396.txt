when giving the history of the enus. Asaroed-side tres, it has been much
planted, in modern times, in olland, Flandma, and in some parts of France
and Ges-many. ln the foresta ol France, it is so abundant, in some places, as
to form the prevailing tree over extensive tracts os country ; and it furnishes
fuel for the adjoining towns; more especially sor balrers' ovens, those ol Paris
being almost entirely heated with the wood of this tree, which is there called
letos blanc. ln Britain, the white poplar has been propagated in nurseries
since the time of Miller; but it does not appear to have been ever very exten·
sively lanted in messes, though there are trees ol' it to be found here and
there thro hout the country. ln Scotland, it wasapo ular tree about the
