Ita wood, which is extremely light and tender, is used, in France, sor making
whetstones, from its facility in receiving and retaining the emery arrd the
oil that aream loyed to sharpen smiths' tools. The voli wood is white, and
the heartwood yellow. It loces a great deal in weight by drying; but it
acquires by that process so much strength and clasticrty, that the ocream ol'
wine-presses are made os it. When used aa fuel, it does not give every
intense heat; but its charconl has the valuahle property of consuming very
slowly. The fruit is mteemed demulcent and laxative; ondit has been long
used rn domestic medicine as a poultice. King Heaekiah’s boil was cured hy
