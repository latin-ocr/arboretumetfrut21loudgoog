William 11, mamed 110100,οη the bremt, w 'ch stroke he insterrtly ⁸
died, on the sd 01 August, 110⁰.” “King William ll. being thus alain,
was laid in a cart belonging to one Purkess, and drawn from hence to Wan-
chester, and huried in the cadredml church 01 that city.'' “That tha spot
¹ wherean evsst so memorable hs pened might not'hereat'ter he unknown,
this stone was set up by John Lo Delswsre, who baa seen the tree growing
in this place.” (GilpinsForest Scen.,i. .161.) This stone was erectedin
17453 and itis said that, in the reign 01 &ntea 11, the oak was palad round
by that monarch’s command, in order to itspreservation. This trae appears to
have blossomed at Christmas, like the (ledenham Oak, mentioned below.

The Cadenham Oak, about three miles l'rom Lyndhurst, hanother 01 the
remarkable trees 01 the New Forest. Thia trec, which buda ev year at
Christanas, is mentioued by ‘'amden. ‘⁶ Having osten heard 01 “ oak,''
says Gilpin, ‘⁸ Ι took a ride to see it on the aeth 01 December, lvsl. It was
pointed 0οι ιο 00 amo several other oaka‚ surrounded byalittle forest
stream, winding round s noll 00 which they stood. It is a tall straight
plant, 0100 great age, and apparently vigorosa, except thet ita ιο has been
mjured, from which several branchos issue in the form 01 pollard s oots. lt
was entirely bare 01 leaves, aa far sal could dimern, when Isaw it, and un·
distinguisbable hom the other ouks in its neighbourhood; except that its
bark seemed rather ,smoothen occasioned, 1 apprehended, only by frequent
¹ climhing. Havinghad the account 01 its earl buddlng confirmed on the spot,

1 engaged one Michael Lawrenoe, who kept the white Hasna small alehouse
in then ’ bourhood, ιο send me some 01 the leaves ιο Vicar’s iiill as soon
aa they ould appear. The man, who had not the least doubt about the
matter, kept his word, and sent me several tw’ oa the eth 01 anuary, 1782,
aiew hours after they had been gathered. T e leaves were fmrly es ded,
and about lin. 10 length. From some 01 the budstwo leaves had uns eathed
themselves, but, in neral onl one.” (For. Socra, i. p. 111.) One 01 the

0010110100Μο was notonlyin leaf, hut had
its flower buda perlectly formed, on December 21. 17813 so that this pmperty
01 coming early into leaf had been communicated to its offspring. “The
early spring 01 the Cadenham Oak,’' Gilpin continues, “ is 01 very short dm
ration. The huds, aller unfolding themselves, make 00 hrrther progress, hut
immediatel shrink from the sanson, and die. The trascontinues torpid, like
other (1001100οι trees, during the remainder 01 the winter, arrd vegetatos “
apain in the spring, at the usual seaaon.’' When ‘⁴ 1n full leaf m the middle
o summer, it appeared, both in its form and foliage, exactly like other oaks.”
(itta, p. 111.) Another trec, with the same property 01 early germination,
has been found near the spot where Rufus’s monument stands. This seems
to authenticam Camden's account 01 the death 01 that rincet for he speaks,

The Bertle 1101, 10 Holt Forest, according to a letter from R. Marsham
Esq, in the hart 100101 rPapers, was, in 1159, 34st. in circumference at
ist. from the grouml, d was found, 20 years alterwards (viz. in 1118), ιο
have increased only half an inch. hir. Marsham accounts sor taking the
measureao 1 hom the ground, by mention' that there was an excres-
cenoe about duh. or stt. high,{which would have rendered the measure unfair.
At Beaulieu Abbey, Gilpin observes, there was, some years ago, “ a very
extraordinaryinstance osv tation. The main stem 01 00 oak arose in
contact with a part 011110011Ιῖ which was entire, and utended one 01 its
priucipal limbs along the summit 011ι. This lint, at the (110ιο000 01 afew

robably be some depositos 0011, ahot a root through it into the earth.

hbence shooting up again through another 01 the wall, it formed-a new

stem, as large as the original tree; and frona t is proceeded another honaontal .
