The Suous, who settled in Britain ahorn the middle of the fifth century, were

Their vessels, we ere told by· Aneurin, e Welch hercl, ‘⁴ were ringtennstet
carrying oue square scil. They had-curved bottoms, end their prowsend poops
were adorned with the heeds end tails ofmonsters.'’ (See dedoy Magnete,

rous vessels, some of which carried sirty oers3 end his erremies the Dsnes
were elso celebrated for their ships. The E lieh vessels, et this period, are
- known to have been of onir ; and thet the ' ones were built of the
saure timber is extremely probable. Professor Burnet, writing on this sub·
ject, seys, “ An ancient vessel was discovered, sorne years ego,uv e bruach of
the river Rothen, near the west eud of the Isle of 0mey, in Kent, and about
two miles from the spot where formerly stood the Romen city of Anderida.
The timber of which this vessel was constructed is oelr, perfectly sound, and
nearly es herdae iron ς end rome persons believe it to be one of the lieet
