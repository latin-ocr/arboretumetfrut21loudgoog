tilbert orchsrd, the defect cun rendily be supplied, when the femsle blossoms

(which ere easil known by being sessile an solitsry‚ or in small clusters, and
of a bright scariot colour) are expunded, by collectiug mele blossoms from
wild trees, or any others where the oen be spered, arrd suspendrng them on
the upper branchos of the trec. The Rev. G. Swsyne has proved the utility
of thrs practice, both in his own csse, end in thet of some of his neighbours.

that the kind of pruning which is found the best for the currant is also the
best for the filbert. Filberts intended for long keepiug, this author observes,
“should remain on the tres till the ere thoroughlyri e; which is easily
known by their rich brown colour. 'lhey should be lai onadryfloorfore
few days, end estmoerds stored in jars of dry send, where the will keep
sound forsgrest length of time.'’ (mnas cessator, p. 190.) llitbero are
always kept tn the husk, and sold by the ound ς while nutu ere kept with·
out the husk, and sold by the pech or bushel. The Bercelons nuts ere inr-
ported in boxes, and kept in thern till told3 while the English nuts ere
' brought to maritet in secks, end kept in them, or on the floors of tofus, or in
dry cellere, till they nre tehen out to be exposed for sele. Filberts ere
brought to merket, by the growers, in boxes3 end ere preserved, by the fruit-
erers, in layers in lol’ts, or ιιι dry send in cellsrs. After sometime, the husks
lose their colour, end sp eer blech end mould ς when they are slightly fumi-
gated with sulphur, till their colour js restored. This¹ operation is performed
by putting them on treys, preteeti vrtth holes, and holding them over s ebeling-
drsh of c erooel, on whrc s lrttle powdered sulphur hed been throtvn when
the charcoel was red-bot. The trsy should be gently shuken,end the filberts

The coleopterous insects are confined to the families Curculionidae end Chry-
