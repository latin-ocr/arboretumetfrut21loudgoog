alread observed that the chestnut, ln Britain, is chiefly planted on the margins
of urchards, for the purpose of sheltering them. lt is also occasionally planted
in hedgerows; but, from tha density of the head, the early appearance of the
foliage, and its long continuance before it drops, the tree is mjurious botb to
the hedge and to the grass below.

Aa aa commeatui Trea, Sang observes that many chestnuts should not be
planted near a residence; because “the flowers emit a very powersul and dis·

reeable odour, which is offenaive to most people.” Gilpin considers the
c estnut, in maturity and perfectiori, as a noble trec, which “grows not unlilre
thanah. lta ramilication is moreat ling; but it is easy, and its foliage loose.
This ia the tres which greces the lan scape of Salvator Rosa. In the moun·
turns of Calabria, where Salvator painted, the chestnut flourished. There he
studied itin all its forms, breaking and disposing it in a thousand beautifrd
shapes, aa the exigentes of bis composition required. 1 have heard, indeed,”
continues ffitpin, ‘⁴ that it is naturally brittle‚ and liable to be shatteredb
winda, which might be one reason of Salvator's attachment to it; but, altbou
l have many times seen the chestnut, in England, old enough to be in a fruit-
bearing state, yet lhave seldom seen it in a state of full picturasque maturity.”
(For. aaa.) Bosc says: ‘⁸ As an omamentaltree, the chestnut ought to be
placed before the nah. Its beautiful leaves, which are never attached by in·
secta, and which hang on the trees till very late in autumn, mass better than
those of the oak, and give more shsde. An old chestnut, standing alone, pro·
duces a superb effect. A group of young chestnuts forms an excellent bach·
ground to other treea; but a c estnut cop ice is msu portably monotonous.”
(Noua. Coars, dvc, art. Chitaignier.) ln hriush paride, the chestnut is dis·
pla ed to most advantage when standing singly, or m scattered groups along
with the oak ς and the gradation in the foliage and martncrof tuftinp formed by
Q. sessilillbra, between the chestnut and Q. pedunculista, forms a p easing hu.
mony, interesting both in abotanical and a picturasque point of view. ln hilly
grounds, the allusion which the chestnut creares to the Apenninea alforda a
pleasing argument for lanting it in such situations.

soit aad Sdaadon. phe chestnut, like the beecb, prefers a deep aandy loam.
lt will not thrive in stiff tenacious soil; and, in a rich loam, its timber, and
even its poles and hoops, are brittle‚ and good for nothing. ln loamy soils at
the bottom of mountarns, aa at Aloa, in btirlingshire; ln loam incumbent on
clay, aa at Brechin Castle, in Forfarshire3 and m similar soils and situations3
it attalus a large siae, and in so short a time, that, accordin to Sang, wherever
the chestnut ia planted in its proper soil and situation, it wilioutpow any other
trea in the same length of time, except, perhaps, the larch,t awillow, and
some of the poplars. According to Bosc, it will not thrive in calcareom soil;
butclayeyandsand soils,andtbosslying0vergranite,gneise,andschistus,and
which arc compos of tha debris of these rocks, appear particularly suitable for

it. lt thrives well amonp rocks where there is apparently very little soil; in.
