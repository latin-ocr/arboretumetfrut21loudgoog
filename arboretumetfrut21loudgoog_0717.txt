quite narrow at thebaselike the hornbeam= but beechisgreatly superiorto e
hornbeam, in the richer colour of its foliage. In Belgium, particularly in the
village of St. Nicholas, between Ghent and Antwe , very close and handsoms
hedges are made with young beech trees, plant tiu. or Sin. spart, with
their heads inclining in o posite directions, at an angle of 46⁰, so as to crosa
one another at right angios, and thus form a wall of trelliswork, the open
maures of which are bin. or 6in. on the side. During the first year, the
plante are bound together with osiers at the points of intersectiou, w ere they
finally become gustet, and grow together. Dr. Neill found a bedge of this
sort ili. high, between Contr and Mechlin, in 1817. (See Joam .Hort. naor,

As aa emmeant Tiso for the parlr and the lawn, especially near the msn· ι
sion, the beech has many important advantages. Though its head is more
compact and lumpisb than that of the oals, the elm, or the ash, yet its lower
branchcs bang down ιο ιΙιο ground in more liant and gracefid forms then
those of any of thess trees. The points o these brancbes turn up with
acurve, which, tho h not picturasque, has a character of its own, which will
be found generally p easing. Thu leaves are beautiful in every period of their
existence: nothing can be frner than their transparent delicacy when expand-
ing, and for some weelrs afterwards In summer, their smooth texture, and
their deep yet lively green, are highly tgretifying to the epac and the warmtb of
their umber tint, when they hang on etrees unng the winter meson, as con·
trastedwitb tbe deep and solemn een of ines andium, henrich, striking,
and most agreeable effect in bagme. ence a few beech ιιοοο are very
desirable on the margin of pine and fn woode‚ or among evergreens generally;
more especially when the soil is somewhat good and moist3 under which crr-
cumstances alone will full-grown beech trees retain their leaves during the
winter. So desirable is the effect produced by the beech with its leaves on
in the winter maon, that when the trees, from age or any other cause, drop
their leaves iu autumn, we would recommend the substituting of young bees,
which seldom fail to retain their leaves d ' winter, till they approach
towardantimber sinc. lt is certain, howe'ver,t someindividual beecbes
are much more tto retain their leaves through winter than othersy for
which reason as cient number of young trees ought to be planted, to allow
of the rooting out of those which do not nnswer the end ru view. Beech
trees under 30 or 40 years' growth, when cut down to the round, push up
agaim and the leaves on the sboots so produced seldom ‘l to remaiu on
during the winter. Low growths of this sort will, in many cases, produce the
desued effect as wellas trees3 a circumstance which may afford a usefirl hint
to the ssessors of grounds of limited extem.

The caves of the beech are less liable ιο be eatan, either by inrecte or by
cattle, than those of almost any other tree. The first circumstance rendere
the beech very desirable for situations near tlre eye, and for avenues arrd
hedges; and the second rendere it one of the best parlr trees, since its
branches, though they are injured by cattle, are far less so than those of the
oalr aud the alm. Two other circumstances which render this au excellent
parlr tree are, tbe food which its mast atfords no decr and s ‘ els, to pea-
cocks audather ornamental poultry, and to p' ns, thmffing blaclrbtrds,
and other birds. The densrty of its head m es it an excellent rightly
shelter for singing birds. The amootbness and light colour of the barlr, and
the circumstance of the uunlr being clothed with branchec to within a short
dhmnce of the ound, render it a desirable tree ιο place a seat undery
tbe eye feeling c light colour of the smooth berk to be more enliveni
than tbe darlr rough·fnrrowed barlr of the oalr or English elm, the wag
smooth gloomy barlr of the Scotch elur, the lichen-covered hoary barlr of
tbe ash, or the reddish brown, cracked‚ and scaly barlr of tlre Scotch pina.
The only trec which can be compared to the beech, as one to sit under, is the

platanum but the shade of this last trec is much less dense. The ancients
