1 S. ra. 13 crispa—A specimen received from Mr. Donald, nurseryrnan‚
Woking, Surrey, narued S. crispa‚is very different from S. crispa
Fordes iu Sal. Wod, and seems clearly S. dlba. The 0 ecimerr con-
siste of a young shoot of the year, bearing leaves3 an these leaves
are narrow, contorted, and silky. So far 00 we can judge from the
single specimen, the kind rnay be regarded as 0 variety ol' S. silba,

1 S. 0101001 Lodd. Cat, ed. rasa-The plant in Messrs. Loddiges’s
collection under this uamedoes not show any obvious marks 01
difference from, S. silba, nor any striking appearance of rosiness.
The epithet rosea, may probably have been applied in relation to the
roseceoua tulhs 01 leaves which are sometimes souud on S. tilba, as
00110011 under S. Helix.

Properties und Uace, ln the north of Europe, the bark of this trec is
used for tauning leatber, and for dyeing 0 01 0 cinnamon colour; and the
leaves aud young shoots are given to cett e in a green state, or dried like the
twigs of the birch, and laid up for winter fodder. The iuner bark os this tree,
like that of Scotch pine, being kiln-dried, aud ground into a fine flour, is mixed
with 0000001, and made into breed, 10 sessona of great scarcity,by 111010110ὴὶ1-

during which it loses a sixteenth part of its bulk. ln ship ttoms, Mr.

stand a hundred years3 aud, with the exception of about half au inch 00 the
ameide, the wood has been found so fresh at the end of that period, as to be
fit for bost-building. (Gurd. Mag„ vol. i. p. db.) The woodis also used in
turnery, mill-work,coo ry, westher-hoerding, &c.; and the abonger sboots

and poles serve for m ing hoops, handles to hay-rakes, clothes-propa (see
