Description. Larga trees, with pinnate leaves, cosme-grained wood, aud
fruit, in one species at least, much aeoeemed at the dessert, and valuable for the
oil which it contains.

General Obesi-notione. The trees belonging to this order bear, with only
two or three exceptione, so close a resemblance ιο one another in their
young state (in which state alone most of them are to he seen in Britain),
that we have been unable to satisfy ourselves as ιο what are species, and what
are only varieties. In pursuance os our idea, that no plant ean be trulya
species, that is not readily distinguished from every other, in every stage of
its growth, and at every season of the ear, we should say that there were
not nrore than two species of walnut hitherto discovered, either in Europe or
America; viz. Jhgluns regia and J. nigrat and three species of Chr-yn vra. 0.
amara, C. lucinidsa, and C. squameas. We submit this opinion, however, with
great delerence, having formed it chiefly from inspecting the young planta in the
Horticultural Society’s Garden, in the collection of Messrs. Loddiges, and from
observing the great variety of foliage distinguishable in abed ofseedlings of any
of the American sorts ς we shall therefore adopt the descriptione and ligures
of Michaux, and leave the truth to be discovered by time and future observa-
tion. Previously to describing the speclea of the three genera, Jrlglans, Chrys,
and Pterocdrya, we shall note Michaux’s introductory observations; pre·
mining that this author iniludes both Jdglans and Ciryaunder theganus
rugiens, the genus chrys, as we have seen in the generic characters above,
having been separated from Jhglans by Nuttall, chie y οιι account of a tech-
nical distinction in the fruit. “The waluuts of North America,” Michaux ob·
serves, “appear to rcsent characters so distinct, as to require their division

into two sections. ibose characters consist principally in the form of the bar·

nut hickory (C. aquatica Nutt, lig. 1265. in p. 1444.)‚ mocker-nut hickory
(C. tomentdsa Nntt, fig. 1267. in p. itas), shell-bark hickory (C. dlba
Nata, fig. 1269. in p. latu), thick shall-bork hickory (0. sulcbta -Nun,
lig. 1271. in plata), pig-nut hickory [θ. porcina Nata, fig. lars. in plato),
and nutmeg hickory (C. myristieaefdrmis Nata, fig. 1275. in pilot). The first
three speciesof the second section bear some relation to those of the first
in their buds, which are not covered with scales. For this reason, 1 have
placed them immediately next, beginning with the pacans-out hickory, which,
by its numerous leallets, most nearly resembles the black walnut and the
butter-nut, the huda of which are also uncovered. Throughout the United
Statcs, the common name of hickory is given to all the species of the second
section. This common appellationis due to certain properties of their
wood; viz. coarseness of grain, and a reddish colour ιιι the beart-wood,
which, however modified, are possessed by them all, in a greater degree than
by any other tree of Europe or America. These species exhibit, also, a
striking analogy in their forms and in their leaves, though they differ in the
number and aize of their leaflets. Το these sources of confusion must be
added another in the fruit, which is often so various in its appearance, that it
is easy to mistake the species to which it belongs. It is not, then, οιι ιΙιο
most remarkable differences alone that our distinctions must be founded;
recourse must also he had ιο an examination of the' shoots of the preceding
year, οξ the buds, and of the aments.’' (liliola. North Αιιιεν. Sylva, vol. ι.
