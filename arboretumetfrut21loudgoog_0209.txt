Huyme Denda, as cited in Koch Comm. lt seems that Koch (comm.) and
lindley (synope. Brit. Fi.) view the kinds of the group Purpureae which
have onl l etantanto a flower, as having that stamen constituted of 2 oom-
biued. hesidas the kinds oflthat group treated-of in our work, exclusively of
S. rirbra, which may be examined as to the testing of this view, S. oppositi-

male, and‚” therefore, “the female ought always to be preferred when the

isof a very different opinion frorn Dr. alker,asserting that between a male
aad a female plant of the sarna species “ there is not the slightest possible dif-
fereaoe in the character or appearance of the two individuale, in any other
raspect’' thau in their flowers. (Eng. Flor.,vol. iv. .163.) Most other
bonnae seem to incline more to tha opinion of Dr. alker, than to that of

Hybrida The production of hybrida in this genus was observed by Sco-
poli in 1760, and has since bcen confirmed or admitted b most other bota-
nists. ‘⁸ The great number of hybrida in this genus,’' och observes, “no
one can deny.'’ (p. 9.) Sir J. E. Sinith, however, forrucd quite ndilferent
opinion. During the thirty years that he studied the willows rn ΜΓ. Crowe's
garden, along with that botanist, “ seadlings innumernble,” he says, “springing
up all over the ground, were never destroyed till their species were de·
sennen and the immutability of each verified by our joint inspection. This
was the aiore material, to set asida the gratuitous suppositione of the mixture
of species, or the productiori of new or hybrid ones, of which, no more than
of any change in established species, 1 have never met with an instance.

e alterations in the shapes aud sizes of leaves, and their stipulas, have,
ind been seen on young radical shoots, from a trae or buah that has been
felled; but not more than usually happens in po lars, liures, eluas, and
others.” ( Eng. Fi, iv. p. 165.) lt is munh to be wished that sorne cultivator
of willows would endeavour to originate, scientifically, sonis hybrida between
specics with opposite characters of foliage, which would set this question
at rest.
