with an instrument called a shave,and afterwards dividcd into ribands by
asteel comb with sb teetb. Similar willow bats were formerly manufac·
tured in England, and s reeta of what is called willow, which is a kind ol' stuff
worn witb fine strips of the wood and asterwards stiffened, are still in common
use for the sramework of bonnets; and, when covered with felt, lor light cbeap
summer hats. This stuff is chiefly manufactured by the weavers at spiraturus,
where one set of persons cut the willows into thin strips, aud others weave
these ' into sheets.
'Themdbnswny substance. which envelopes the seeds is used by some
kinds of huda to bne their nests; and by man, occasionally, as a substitute
ior cotton, in staffing mattresses, chair cushions, and for other similar pur-
ppses. In many parts of Germany‚ it is collected lor making wedding lor
' ing ladies’ winter dresses3 and accerse paper may be formed of it. The
sboots of willows of certain vigemus-growing kinds, when cut down to the
ground, produce, in two years, rods which admit of being split in two sor
boops l'or barrels3 while others, in 'one year, produce shoots more or less
robust, and of different degrees ot' length, which are used, with or without their
berk on, for all tbe different kinds ol basket-making and wickervvork. This
last application, indeed, is by far the most general purpose to which the willow
isapplied. ln the neighbourhood ⁰.f London, the market-gardeners use the

smallcr sboots os willens are used sor tying the branches of trees to walls or
sepelies-s, for tying up standard trees and shrubs into shape‚ sor making
skeleton frames on which to train planta in pots, for tying bundles and park-
sgea, aad for a thousand other purposes which are familiar to every gardener,
or vill readily occur to him in practice. The lop ol willows, and all tbe
branches or old trunks which can be applied to no other usesul purpose,
makes most agreeable fuel, producing, when dry, aclearfire with little smoke;
but, when the wood ismoist,it is aptto crack. In the time of Evelyn, willow
wood ap s to have been that principally used in the manufacture of char-
coal, bot sor smelting iron, and lor gunpowder; but, lor the former purpose,
it bas long given way to the coke of mineral coal. lt is still in request for

The usesyol the entire plant are various. Almost all the species being
msice, and of rapid and vigorous growth, they are peculiarly fitted lor
planting en the banks ol rivers and streams,sor restraining theu encroach·
ments, and retaining the soil in its place. Various other trees and shrnbs,
bom being also uatics, and having numerous roots, arc, no doubt, adapted for
this purpose, suc as tbe alder ς but the willow has this great advanQe, that

kinds make hedges‚ both in dry and in meist soil; but, in the latter, surb
bedges are of most valae on account of the use of their annual shoots in
basim-making. The sorta of willow that can be genn lor timber with
most advantage are, S. elba, astunensem, S. fragilis, S. cbprca, and sornc
others, wbicb we bava enumerated under the head ol Uulture. The trees

S. amygdalina, and some others. S. caprea is remarkable for the prolusion ofrts
