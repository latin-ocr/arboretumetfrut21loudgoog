Varietiee. Nnttall states (Gead Cat. N. A. Pp that the inhabitants of North
and South Carolina distinguished two kin sol sassafrns, the red and the
white, calling the latter, also, the smooth. The red he identihes with the
L, subgenus Eudemus Nure, Sdrrajrar L.; and the white or smooth he con·
sidere a species belonging to the same subgenus, which he calls L. E. albida
Nata, and of which he has adduced the following characteristica. lts buds
end younger branchos are smooth and glaucous; its leaves are every where
glabrous and thiri, and the veius are obsoleta on the under surfnce3 the
petiole is longer. He had not seen it in flower. 'l'he root is much more
strongly camphorated than the root of the red sort (L. Sdceafiur), aridis
nearly white. This lind is better calculated to answer aa a substitute lor
ochra ( H ibiscus esculentus) than the L. Scissa ,lrom its buda and oun
branchos being much more mucilaginous. tis abundant in Nortl aad
