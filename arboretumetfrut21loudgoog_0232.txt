mountainous districts of Weles and Scotland.

cially in old trees, give riae ιο rottenness in the trunk3 which, in the willow,
from its being comparatively a short-lived tree, takes place, more especially in
wet soils, nmch sooner than in most other species. Mr. mentions Kal,

of willow, articulat-ly three of the most usefnl and ornamentsl, the S. elba,
the S. frigills, and the S. babylonica, are well known to be subject to the
de redatiom of numerous insecta, and of the larvae of the cossus Ligniperda
( eady described as attacking the clm, see p. 1386.) in particular, which faed
on the substance of the wood, and prove uncommoul destnrctive to the
latter speeies3 for, as the larvae in each tree are n ynumerous, in the
course of a few years they destroy so much ο the trunlr, that the first
violent gale of wind blows down the tree. So infested are the weeping
willowa, in many nurseries, with these insecta, that scarcely one in ten ean be
selected free from them.¹' The willowa are infested, also, in the same wa by
the larvae of the Cerdmbyx moechatum and also by those of as ecies o the
Curculidnidse, which was little suspected of committing similar ‹lepredetiona
but which, in proportion ιο its size, is no less destructive than those of the
Cerdmbyx and Cdssus. The larva of a species of Nitldula [atipha ln] are
also found to be injurians in a similar manner ιο those above named.

ln the beginnin of June, 1780, Mr. Curtia observed a young tree of the
uttix vimimllis, wlrich had been planted in his gardan two years, and which
was about uin. in dimneter, throwing out from various parts of ita trunli
a substance aomewhat resembling sawdust, which fell at its base in no incon·
siderahle quantity This substance, on a closer examinatior, was found to
proeeed from ho es about the sizc of a goose-quill, penetrating dee ly into the
substance of the wood, obliquely upwards and downwarda. gnita first
coming out, it appeared of the colour of the wood, and was moiat; and as it
grew dry it becarm of a browner colour. The whole of the trunlr where this
mternrd operation was going forward enitted a smell somewhat lilre beer in a
atate of fermentation; and various insecta, ahured thereby, settled on the trae,
and aeemed eugerly toimbibe nourishment from it :among others, the-Vandalus
Atalanta, Cetoma aurita, Alpis mellifica, Canthans [Te e‘phorus] livida, with
