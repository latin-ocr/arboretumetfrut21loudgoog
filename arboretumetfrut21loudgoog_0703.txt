Horticultural Society, in the autumn 01 1817. This tree had been
ted ou a common beeth stock, about 311. from 111θὶ101111.

total height 01 the tree 11 between bost. and 6011.,11(1 the diameter
01 the headis 1111. 11 was planted 11 1752, and was, cousequendy,
when seen by Dr. Neill, about 65 years old. lt is altogether, says
the doctor, “a very handsomely formed well-balanced tree. To a
spectator standing directly under it, the leaves appear nearly 01 the
usual green colom, and they are but slightly tinged with purple as
far as they are excluded from the sun: 11 they approach outwards,
they gete stronger purplish hue ς and on the very exterior they are
of a deep purple3 msomuch that the tree, when seen from a dis·
tance, appears clothed 11 blaclr ;'’ and hence the name which it bears
in Belgium, 01 rwartae beeckenboom, the blsck beech tree. This tree
every year ri sseeds, 11011 which numerous young plants bave
beau raised, e greater part 01 which have purple leaves; and, in a
young hedge in M. Smetz's garden formed 01 seedling plante from
thie trae, the deputation “ observed every variety of hue ia the
foliage, from green 1ο purple; yet no individual vas completely green
and 1011 completely purple.” (p. 167.) This tree, in all robability,
isthe sameasthet alluded to by Bosc. Onwritingto r. Somme,
Director 01 the Botanic Garden at Antwerp, in May, 1837, he
informs us that the trunlr, at 71111. above the grall, is 1511. 1011. 11
circumference3 but that 116 1. 711. above the graft the circumfe-
1110111311. 1011. less. The diameter 01 the head is 7211, and the
total height 01 the tree is 7211. The handsomest purple beech in

6011. and 7011. high, clothed with branchee to the ground, where
it extended over a space above solt. in diameter. lt stands on
a small lewn in the lessius-grounds, end is, consequently, pro·
