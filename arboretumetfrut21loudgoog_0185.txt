Collinson, in his Hotory ο] δοιιπιειιιὶνσ, speaking ol the Glsstonb
thoro, mentions that there grew also, in the Ahbeychurch yard, on the nort
side oi St. Joseph's Chepel,a miraculous walnut tree, which never budded
forth before the feast ol St. Bamahas (that is the llth ol June), and on that
very day shot forth its leaves, and flourished like other trees os the same

Ρωραὲαιίοπ, ιτ. The species is propagated by the nut3 which, when the
trec is to be grown chiefly lor its timber, is best sown where it is finally ιο
romain, on account of the root, which will thus have its full influence on
the wigour and prosperity of e tree. Where tho tree is ιο he grown for fruit
on dry soils, or rn rocky situations,it ought also ιο besown where it is finally ιο

mbsoils, if sown where it is finally ιο rmnaiu, s tile, siste, or ilat stone should

root a horiooutal direction; or, if this precaution has been neglected, after
the plonts have come up, the taproot may be cut through with a spade sin.

lsnts os the homechesmut, sweet chestnut, walnut, and oah. On the other
hand, when the walnut is planted in soil which has a dry or rocky subsoil,
or among rocks, no pressurum os this sort is necessary: on the contrary, it
would be injuriosis, by preventiog the taproot from descending, and deriuing
that nourishment from the subsorl which, from the nature ol the surfuce soil,
it could not there obtain. The varieties may be prop ed by budding,
grafting, ioerchiug, or lsyering, and, poseibl ,by cuttings o the root.

by French authors3 from which it appears thot, in the north ol Fronte, and in
cold countries generally, the walnut does not bud or grah easily by any mode3
but that, in the south of France, and north ol ltaly, it msy be budded or

by different modes, with success. ht Matr, the Baron de Tschoudy
