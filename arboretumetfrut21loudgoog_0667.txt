then split down in three or four places; care being taken, both in making the
circular cuts, and also the longitudinal ones, not to penetrate the inner barli.
This o eration is commonly performed induly‚ orin the 'nning of August,
when esecond sap flowsplentifully. The tree is nowl tfor8 or loyesrs,
when it is again disbarlred as before3 but the barlr has not even now attamed
the desired perfectiori for the manufacture of corlrs ς and, therefore, itis sold to
the liabermen for their nets, and for different other inferior uses. At the end

taking the barlr offthe common oalr. The corlr, when first removed
, from the tree, is in laminas, more or lesa curved, according to their
breadth, and the diameter of the trec from which they have been re}
talren. To malre them lose this crr‘rved form, after being scraped

and any epiphytes or other extraneoue substames, they arc held over a
blaaing ire till the aurfacc becomes scorched; after which they are laid
flat on the ound, and lre t in that position for some time by large stanes.
This gives t em a set, or lma, which th'ey retain ever afterwards5 and thus
they beccum in a fitter state, not only for pnclring and transportandam but for
being manufactured. The slight charring which the scorching produces has
the effect of closing the porea of the corlr, and giving it what the eorl-cutters
call nerve. The best corlr is not less than lffiu. ru thickness: it is sup le,
clastic, neither woody nor porous, and of a reddish colour. Yellovv eorl is
considered of inferior quality ς and white cork, which has not been charred
on the surface, ss the worst. The duty on manufactured corlr, M‘Culloch
tells us, is prohibitory3 and on the raw material it is ao less than 81. aton.

The tree attains as large a aize in Britain aa it does in Spain, and might
probably produce cork for the above purposes, ifit were fairly tried, in the
warmest arts of England. Michaux strongly recommends its introduction
into the nited Statas, observing that it could not fail to thrive wherever
Q. virens exists3 as, for exam le, on the southern coast, and its adjacent
islanda. Captain S. Ε. (look Ιξιιιιειιῑε the destnrctiou of the corlr trees in
