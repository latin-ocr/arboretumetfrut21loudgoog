of anomnly, as to the manner in which they are disposed‚ or 88 to the con-
stituent parts oi themselves. A collection of cases and instantes is here
presented. Male iiowere and female ones have been observed to occur in the
same catkiu in the following instances :-S. Hoppea'uo wind, as noticed in

besides having the majority of its catkins constituted srtly oi' male flowers
and partly of female ones, has, in some metenses, in tie upper iiowers of 8
catkm, the middle one of the three stamens of a flower changed into 8 perfect
ovary; and, hence, the flower seems as is comprising two stamens and an
ovnry. (11001180000182ι Smith has noticed what may be adistinct case;
viz. that in S. frigilist e stamens are not unfrequentiy accompanied by an
imperfect pistil. (Engl. Fi.) The combination of the filaments, in some kinds,
is a relative subject. Mr. Borrer considers the instance observed in S.
Crowedno 8 monstrosity. (Engl. Bel. Suppl, t. 2655.) He adds that the
stamens ‘⁸ are represented as changing into ” ovaries, ‘⁶ as those oi S. bicolor
Ehrle, and of some of the common sallows, have been observed to d0.’' lt is
likely that Mr. Borrer would apply the same remark to every instance of the
filaments occurring in astate of combination. The following is 8 list of kinds
in which the filsments have been observed in thia state3 and the practical cui-
tivator may instruct himself by investigating, relatively to the above remark,
