they used haael twigs ιο bind their vines. ilie common hezel was called liy
the Romans Nux Avellana, from Avellino, a city in Naplesr where, Swinhurne
tells ns, in aiter times, nuts were cultivated in such ebundsnee, es, in iavomalile
maone, to reduce a profit of lineet. “l do not,'’ says Evelyn, “conloimd

bald hezel nats, which, doubtless, we had froin abmad, and bearing the names
ol Avelan, Avelin, as lfind in some ancient recorda and deeds in my custody,
where my ancestors’ names were written Avelaa, alias Evelin, generally.”
ln the dnrli ages, the hezel was h· hly valued sor ita su posed divining powers.
The following passage froin Evdyn shows the p belief in his time on
this subject: -“ Lastly, ior ridin -switches anddivinatory rods, fni· the de·

the philosophical treatise os Dr. Vallemont (Physipae Omisit, οιι lirare de
Ia Bag-act dianam), which will at least entertain thern with a world oi sur·
prising things.” The belief that certain giiied persons possessed the power oi
discovsr' hidden water or metal, by means of a diviningrod,is as old as
the timendi the Romans3 but the virgula Mercurialis was not always made of
hezel, or even of wood, but sometimes of lirass or other metal. About the
lilleenth and sixteenth centurias, the art was oelled rhabdomancy ς and persons
naturally gilled sor practising it were called rhabdomists. 'l'he diviner tooli
a hezel rod, which was either curved or forlied, and held it b the two ends,
so that its curvature was inclined outwards. Ii the person wdo held the rod
possessed the. power of rhabdomancy, and approached any metallis vein, or
other magnetis substance, or earne near them, a slow rotatory motion of the
rod ensued in different directions, according to particular circumstmoes. (See
Physica! aad Haereat Retearcder into Rhobdoniancy, διας Eleiienii di Eleum
nutrio Aninmle, dic. διο.) In other cases, the rod was peeled, and then laid
on the palin of the hand, with the hut end of the twig on the pnlse os the
wrist; and the divinet moved slowly nlong, till the rod pointed to the desired
place; the rhabdomist feeling at the saine time, either a violent acceleration
or retardation ol the pulse, and a sudden sensation ol* great heat or gasat sold.
