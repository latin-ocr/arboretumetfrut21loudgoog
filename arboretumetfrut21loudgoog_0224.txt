Cattitrg. 'l'he proper season for cutting basket willows is the autumn,
immediately alter the sall of the leaf. The advantage os cutting at this ·
season is, t at the buds which are lest to produce the shoots for tbe succeed-
ing crop immediately begin to swell, and grow iu strength during the winter3
and, consequently, they make much earlier and stronger shoots in thefollowing
spring. Imnrediately alter cutting the rods, they are ried up in bundles, caclr
generally ahorn list. 9iu. in girt, and if they are not intended to be used green,
that is with the barlr on, they are set on their thick ends iu standing water,
to the depth of ³in. or diu. Here they remain during winter and spring,
till the ehoots hegin to sprout, which generally hap ens, rn the neighbourhood
of London, about the end of February, when they are ready to be peeled.
Sometimes it happens that osiers are cut with the leaves on, in which case they
should never be tied up in bundles, on account oi the sermentation thet would
be produced by binding them closely together in that stete3 but the rods
should be set up thinly and loosely on end, their tops leaning against a rod
su ported on two propr.

ln Cambridgeshrre, when abasketmslrer purchases green rods, he mensures
the bundles, or bolts, as they are termed‚ by a band un ell long (ly yard, or

rods ere laid aeide, from their filling up the given space more qurckly than the
srnaller ones; and all the rods must be laid parallel to one another in the
bundle. Three bande are bormd round each bundler viz. one towards ench
extremity, and the third in the rniddle. The one nearest the lower end, which
should be at the distance of l stein from the bottom, is the measuring band.
