thia, it is proved by the practice in Belgium, is only an imaginary evil, ro·
vided the superfluous shoots sre removed irom the up extremity o the
decapitated tree the secorrd year, and the head forme with common care

ferred to, in theatrales, and also the account of the Belgica practice, in
the Gardeuer'r Mogariasvol. x. p. 8.) ln Britain, young elrn meas, havingbeen
tvo or three times transplanted in the nurscries, are placed in their final
situations without heading doum andin our rnoist climate they grow vi·
gorously the lirst year, and uire very little pruning. On the Continent,
owing to the ter ναπιιῐὴᾟ the summere, and the consequent increased
evaporation our the leaves, plante are liuble to be killed when mana
planted with all their branches ony and, hence, the mode of denuding the
planta just described is that generally practised. In Franco and Belgium, the
ustrou-tesval elm is the most common tree planted by road sides, and along
the boulevarda and streete of towns and cilicet sud, in such cases, a large pit
ispreviouslydug, ist. or hit. in diameter, and from 2 a. toust. in depthy and a
considerable ortion osrich line mould is placed iu immediate contsct with
the roots ostiis trees, and the it filled up with the hest part oi the soil which
had been previously dug out oiit. During the first summer, water is regularly
supplied ; and the trees, or rather stumps, grotv freely; very little attention is
required afterwards, except to encourage the leading ahoot, and to sborten
in the laterai branches, so ae to encourage the plant to assume a trae-like
torm. ln the neighbourhood of Paris, and intbe south of Franco, U. carn-
peatris, sud several ol its varieties, ocmsionally bear soedst and these are
sometimes sovn by the nurserymen, in order to procare new sorts; and by
the managers of the nafional foresta, in order to obtain nummous planta at a
cheap rate. The common English elur very rarely producesaeeds in Englandy
nevertheless it has done so in a few places, and one ol these is Lea Park,
near Littlehourne, about four miles from Canterbury. Mr. Masters oi (lan-
terbury has only known sceda twice ripened in this lx; and one citha
times they did not germinate. From those which 'd he obtained U. c.
viminhlis, and nearly ascore other very distinct varieties, which, however,
from the number of vstieties already existing, aod the little demand lor theut,
he did not consider vonh laeping separate, and giving names to. U. c.
stricta, and some other varieties oi the common elm, as well aa tha species,
flower very profusely every year, but scarcely ever ripen sceda

lt is observed by Bosc, that the more remarkable varieties, such ss the
twisted elm, the broad-leaved elm, the litus-treelesved ehu, dre, come
tolerably true from secde eaking of the ruass oi young plantat but that among
these are constantly need numerous subverleties. The seeds full from
