οι ιιιιιοιι berk, when dried and pulverlsed‚ to yield loe. of salicine. (Ihid.)
The wood of the willow is soft, smooth, and light: that of the salix caprea
is beavier than that of any other speeies of the genus, weighing, when dry,
kl lb. θοι, per cubic foot, and losing a twelfth part of its bulk in drying; that of
salix dlba weighs 2'llb. 6 oz. per cubic foot when dry, and loses,in dryiug, some·
what more than a sixth part of its bulk. ln Pliny’s time, willow wood was in ro·
quest for the fabrication of sbields, ou account of its lightness; and in the present
day, it is, for the same reason, preferred for making cutting-boards for the use of
shoemakers and tailors. Ιι is also used for whetting the fine steel instrumente of
eorkeutters, aud other mechanica. lt is in demand for-turnay, and for shoes,
shoemukers' laste, and toys; for dyeing black, in imitation of ebony, as it takes
a fine polish; and for a great variety of minor purposes. The wood of the
larger trees, such as S. ftlba and S. tessellata, is sawn into boards sor floor-
ing, arrd sometimes for rasters; in which last situation, when kept dry ‘aud
ventilated, it has been known to last upwards ofa century. The straight
seems of young trees, when split in two, make excellent styles for field laddere,
on account of their lightness. The boards are well adapted for lining waggons
and cares, particularly such as are intended for eoals or stenes, or any hard ma·
teriel‚ as willow wood, like other soft woods, is by no means liable to splrnter
from the blow of any hard angular material. It is alsovalued for the boards
of the paddles of stetim-vessels, and for the strouds of water-whecls, as it
wears in water better than any other kind of wood. The red-wood willow,
or stag's-head osier. ( S. fragilis),according to Mathew, produces timber superior
to that of S. alba, or of any other tree willow. lt is much used in Scotland
for building small vessels3 and especially for fast-salling sloops of war, by
reason of its lightness, pliancy, elusticity, and toughness. The wood, when
dry, is easily known from that of all other willows, by its being of a salmon
colour; on which account ιι is sometimes used in cabinet-making and for
children’s toys. “ Formerly,'' says Mathew, “ before the introduction of iron
hoops for cart whecls, the external rim, or felloe, was made of this willow; and,
when new‚the certor wain was drawn along a road covered with hard smallgravel
(and,in preference, gravel somewhat angular) 3 by which means the felloe shod
itself with stone, aud thus became capable of cnduring the friction of the read
for a long time, the toughness end elasticity of the willow retaining the gravei
till the stone wes worn away. Under much erposure to blows and friction,
this willuw outlasts every other honre timber. ⁴When recently eut, the ma-
tured woodis slightl reddish,and the sep-wood white. When exposed to
the air, and gradu ly dried, both are of saltum colour, and scarcely dis-
tinguishable from each other.” (Oa Nau. Tiinb, p. 63.) S. Russellidau being
very nearl allied to S. fragilis, its wood has, probably, the same charae·
teristies. ine longer slroots und branches of the tree willows are mede into
poles for fencing, hup-poles, prope for vines, and other· purposes3 and, when
forked at one end, into props for sup orting lincs for clothes. They are also
much used for the handles of hay-r es, and other light agricultural imple·
menen and they are split, and made into hurdles, cretes, and hanapem and,
when interwoven with the smaller bmnehes,into racks, or cradles, lor the hay
and strew given to cattle in the fields, or in seeding-yards. The smaller rods,
with or without the berk on, are rnnnufactured into various kinds of baskets,
for domestic use; and,split up into two, four, or nrore pieees, for making
lighter and ornamental articles, such as work-baskets, ladies' reticules, &a
lt is a remarkable fact, that becket-making was one of the few manufactures
in which the ancient Britons excelled in the times of the Romans. These
baskets, or bascaudae, as they are called by Martial, are said to have been of
{fyfihfftfdaflfinll'fdlf lttltttt ‘'allis'‘ t‘ttilttftttlfs
strips or shavings of the wood dfthe S. atba', in the same manner as they ere
manufactured tn Swrtzerland from shavings of the wood of Daphne Laureola;
endas they were, some years ago in Esses, from the wood of Populus fastigiata.
