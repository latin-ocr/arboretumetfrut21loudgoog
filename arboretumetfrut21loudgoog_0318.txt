It is shown, under the preceding group, that Mr. Borrer rofesses
himself not acquainted with all the inda of that group aud is; and
that be may, therefore, bave placed some of them wrongly. lt ma in·
terest the lovers of broad grounds of distinction in species to know
that Koch, who bas ap lied this principle to the willows, has included
several of the kinds in tiis oup, which are treated below as distinct s e·

species. Dr. Lindi ,in his Sympsiso nearent Flora, where he bas

rendering species in the willows thus comprehensive, r. Borrer makes the
following remark in Eng. Boi. Suppl, t. 2702.:—“ We have repeatedl

has added, “ Of these saeve* princeps is Koch, whose lucid De Salicibm
Europen Commendatio displays a most intimate acquaintance with bis
subject.’' With d to the details of Koch’s ad'udication of the above·

notices, which, for esake of accur-ac ,we give below:-
