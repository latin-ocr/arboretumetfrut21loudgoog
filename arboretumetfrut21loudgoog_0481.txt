Comparing the forms and outlines ol oalis with the forms aud outlines of
other trees, we shall lind that they liave greatly the advantage in point ol
character and vadem. The forins ol all the pins and fir tribe, more especially
before they begin ιο decay, are monotonous3 and the same may be said esen
ol the forms ol the cypress, the Lombardypoplar, and the weeping willow.
it we imagine ourselves in a forest ol pines, lirs, Lomberdy poplnrs, or
weepiug willows, it is easy to conceive the melancholy impression that tlie
scener would produce on uss aad hence, perhaps, the suitableness ol these,
and o er unilorm choadad trees, lor caeteries. But let us imagine
ourselvesinalorest ο oalis, either ol one liiud, or of severid kinds; and
how different will be theideaa that will aiise in our minda, aud the effect
that will he produced on our spirits l Oaks, then, not only stand alone in

Soil,Sitastios,and Climsta Tpg, calis, both ol Euro and America, to atteia
their fiill siae, require a deep loamy soil, a situation ow rather than elevated
and a climate not lisbls ιο late spring lrosts. It is remarkable that, even iii
counnies where the oali isindigenoua, both its blossoms aad young leaves are
frequently injuied by the frosts ol spring. The oslrs which llourish on the
worst soils are the low-growing kinds belonging to the section Pler, and
some ol' the American calis, especiall those belonging to the group Phellos3
andthose which require the best collare, the Q· sessililldra, the werris,
and most ol the, sorta comparing the American grou Riibrae. Inelevated
situations, or in the extreme north, those species w 'ch- under favourable
circumstances lonii the most magnificent trees become, as iu the csse ol every
other tree, mere shrubs.

with cult by every other mode except from seed3 and, generally, time will
be gained when the acorns are sown where the planta are intended finally to
romain. It is only, therefore, when peculisi· mrieties are to be continued, that
the process of gralling is resorted to; and the mode by ep rosch is almost the
only one that is certain ol being attended with success. linere are instantes,

the best stocli is Q. Cerris; on which, also, many ol the sorta may he suc-
cesslnlly budded; a practice which, we are inlorined by M. Rosenthsl, is
general in the Vienna nurseries.
