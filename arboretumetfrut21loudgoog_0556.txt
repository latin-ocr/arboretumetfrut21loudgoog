ebnost every ease, prefer using strong transplanted planta ιο acorna. We
hare already rernarlred that oaks, aller they hare οιιιιιιιοά a certain siae, are
more successfully trans lanted than seedbngs of one or two ears; a fact
,which will be found toli li
of extramdinery dimensione when young. One reason which some 're for
preferring acorns is, the alleged injury which oalr planta aratain by e loss
of the taproot, which, it is sard, they never regain. 'l'his opinion, bewermiis
well known to be erroneous; it being as natural, in the case of seedling
osks, for that part of the plant which is under ground to reproduce a leading
. or tap root when that has been cut off, as itis for the art above ground to
ὁ reproduce a leading shoot aster thet hasbeen removed. itis also equally well

conceive that, ιι the surface soil on which an acorn is planted is much richer
than the subsoil, something in rapidity of growth will be gained by cutting off
the teproot, so as to force the ant to send out lateral roots sooner thenit
otherwise would do; but, thougli something is gained by this, something, elso,
will be lost3 because the supply of water, so essenbal to all plante which
hare naturally taproots, in a r young state, will be considerably diminished.
In warm climates, therefore, an ιιι all cases where a saving of first eost is an
object, we should prefer acorna to plants3 but in tolerably meist climates, and
