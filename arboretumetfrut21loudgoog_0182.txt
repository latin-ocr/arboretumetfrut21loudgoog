Grenoble, ‘⁴ of all others the most beautiful and esteemed.” 'l'o render the
wood better coloured, Evelyn continues, “joiners pnt the bosrds into an
oven after the beteh is forth, or lsy thern in a warnr stablea arrd, when they
work it, polisb it over with its ovvn oil, very hot, which makes it look blaclr
and sleelrr and the older it is, the more estimable: but then it should not be

of its brittleuess5 of which, however, it has been observed td giv'e timely
notice, like thet of the chestnut, before it breaks.” (Haut. Evel, p. 172.) For
fuel, according to Bandrillart, the wood, when dry, rs of nearly the same velue
as that of the common sycamore, burnio with 'a mlld flarne; but, as ebareoal,
it is not productiva. ln Britain, the chief uses of the timber sre for gurr-

stoclrs (it ' found ligbter in proportion to its strength and elssticity than
any other), an for musical instrumenta, turnepn,1 and toy-making.

The most valuable part of the wslnut is its it, which is much in demand,
throughout Euro aud other parts of the world, for the table, and for various
other purposer. hia yonn and green state, it is piclrled aod preserved; and,
when mature, it is used ss fond for the poorer classes in the countries where it
sbourwls, and at the dessert of the richer classes. lrr the north of ltely, in Swit·
seland, sud in the south of anee, the rosds arelioed for many miles together
with wslnnt trecor end, during August and September, when the fruit ir ripe,
or nearly so, and the westher so warnr that the shelter of a horraeis not
required to rotect the traveller from cold, he may wall under the shade of
the tres, an eet its fruit during the day, and sleep under it during night. We
have even known the ense of a person who travelled by spublic conveyrroce
from Florence to Genera, eating scarcely an thing by the way but wulnuts
and heads of maine, which he gothered by the road side. About the end of
June, walnuts are preserved, either with or without their buskrr irr the latter
state they are most agreenble, but in the former most strengthening to tlre
stomseh. Gersrd says, “ The green aud teuder nuta, boyled in auger-,and caten
as snellarde, are a most pleasant and delcetnble mente, comfort the stomache,
sod expell poyson.'' A fine stomachis liqueur is made from the young nuts
about the middleoof June; arrd about thre time, also, they are piclrled. ln
August, before the sbells become hard, they are eaten in what the Frencb
call err semoris, that ia, with the hemel, while green, scooped out with a short,
broad, brass knire, aud seasoned with vinegar, salt, peppcr, arrd shallots. The
nntr, for this pur se, should be tehen stleast a lortnig t before they are ripe;
the should be rown into water as soon ss they are separated from the
h ‚end allowed to rernain there till the moment when they are wanted to
be seasoned aod set upon the table. The sessoning may be that already
mentionedr or the juice of green grapes snd salt, without anytbing else.
Towards the end of September, or begrnniug of October, walnuts are seren
raw, and the are good ss long as they continuefresh3 that is, as long as it is
easy to detach the slrin from them; bnt wherr this cannot be removed, the nuts
become indigestrble‚ and their acridity attacks the gurns and the palate. ln
order to preserve them fresh, they ought to be buried, with their green shells
on, in saud or in dry soil, beyond the resch of frost or surface hest, in which
state they will continue fresh for sirr months. Of the dried kemele, a mmeroe
orcle informed3 which, in France, is called sangar, sod is considered very
ngreesble. ln Spain, Evelyn tells us, they strew the grstings of oldand hard
nuts over ¹their tnrts and sweetmeats. In London, young walnuts are much
used for prclrles, and in making catchups, oradulterating noy, nod other· sauses.
The nut of the large-fndted walnut junge, Fr.; the variety No. l. above)
is, in France, made rnto cases by jewcl ers, and furnished with trinkets, for the
amusement of children. In erericlr, it is customary to put a pair of fine
Limericlr gloves into s walnut shell, arrd a dish of walnuts with this kind of
kernel is sometimes presented at table. Thus furnished, they are often sent
ss presente to England3 sod gloves arescot in the same manner from Frsnce.
