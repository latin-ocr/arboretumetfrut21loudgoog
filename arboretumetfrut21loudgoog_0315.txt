Vorietier. Koch and Smith have referred the S. uliginosa erld. and S. aurita
lWld. to the S. aurita L.; and Koch has thus contradistinguished the two
former :— S. uliginosa erld. Tallar. Leares obovate. S. aurlta Willd.
Dwarler. Leares roundiahjobovatc, smaller by hall. Mr. Forbsahasnoticed
that a vanety was gro “ in theWoburn plantatione which was about lli.
or lfa 6in. high, andffl its leavestruly obovate. Koch bas deemed the
S. clsdostemma Hcyne Denda. F1.. p. 191. and fig. a, c, a singular wanmyof
S. aurita, and char-acterised it as having 2, 3, οι· 4εταωειιε to a flower, and
these with their filaments connata to beyond‘the middle. We have a spe-
cimen obtained ol Messrs. hoddigea, undar the name ol S. aurita micro-
phylla, whose leaves are oblong, and do not look ol the affinity ol S. aurita.
Smith judged (Πίον. Brit. and Quid the S. obprea primda, solio subro-
tundo, subtus moeno, ol Dillenrus m aa Syn.. to be a dwarf variety ol S
aurita3 but Mr. Borrer has expressed‚ in Eng.Bot. Supp„ t 2733.. his
opinion that this ‘⁴ is probably a synonyme ol S. ambigua.”
