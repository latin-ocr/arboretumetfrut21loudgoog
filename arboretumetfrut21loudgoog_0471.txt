as holding 1110101110 rank 00100 the plante of the temperate hemispheres
1111111110 lion does among qu rupedn, and the engle among birds; that
is to say, it is the emblem of grandeur, strength, and duration3 of 10100 that
1001010,οε the lion is os 10100 that acts. ln short, its bulh, its longevity, and
the extraordinary strength and dirrability oi its timber, attest its superiority

and sor the construction os ships. In one word, it is the king of forest
trees. The 110011 of the osh is not, in 0110101, remarkable either for its
length, straightness, or freedom srom tranche, except when it is drawn up
among other trees. 111Ι an open situation, the larger species send 001 nu·
10010110 very large horizonta} branches, so as to lorm a head broader than the
tree is high. The branohes, in many oi the species, 010 tortuous towards
their extremities, and furuished with numerous twigs, or spray. The main
100101«111001111,10 most species, descende ndieulsrly to a considerable
depth, unless the subsoil be unpropitious: hierlprl also extends horisontally as
widely 00 the branches3 thus taliiug afirmer hold of the ground than any other
1100, with the exception, perhaps, 01 the 00111111, and oue or two others. The
surlace roots, in only one or two species, throw up suckers. The leaves vary
in different sections 01 the genus. ln what are called 00110 by way 0101111-
nence, such as Quercus llbbur, Q. ritbra, arrd 11001111, which may be 0011-

ash or the acacia, are to be found in many generat bnt not so the lobed
and sinusted leaves of the 00110 01 the three sections above mentioned. ln
other sections, such as that represented by Q. Phellos 0111111.ΙῚο11,1Ι10 leaves

most oi the species, and especially in the larger trees, 1110 leaves are deoi-
duous; but in some sections, ss in Q. Flex and Q. virens, they are ever een.
The flnwers are in all inconspicuous, without corollas, and, in genera ,· ap-
pearing with, or before, the leaves. The female flowers 010,οε iu most smen-
