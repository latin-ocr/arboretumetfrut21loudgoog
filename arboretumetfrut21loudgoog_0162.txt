British catalogues.

Description, dc. The red, or slippery, eim, according to Michaux, hears a
strong resemblance to the Dutch eim. It forms a trec from 50st. to 60ft.
high, and lein. or toln. in diameter. ln the winter, Michaux observes,

«rtis distinguished from the white American elm ᾗ lem

brown3 and the leaves are orel-acuminata doubly

denticulated, and l r, thiclrcr, aud rougher than

those of U. americana. “Except the maritime

districts of the carolinas and Georgia, this species of elm is found in all
parts of the United States aad of Caneda.” (Micheas.) “lt is less
abundent than the white American elrn ς aud the two species are rarely found
together,as the red elm requires a substautial soil, free from moisture,aud
even delights in clevatedand open situations, such as the hanks ofsteep rivers,
particularly the Hudsoo and the Susquehauua. The heartwood is coarcer-
grained andless compact thau that of U. americloa, and is of ιι dull red tinge;
whence the name of red eim. Even in the hrauches of lin. or tin. in diameter,
it consists riucipallyof perfect wood. lt is the best wood in the United
States for bircka ; and it makes excellent rails, which ere of long duration, and
formed with little labour, as the trunlr may he easily and regularly split ς and
this is probably the reason that it is never employed for the naves of wheels.
The leaves, and bark of the hranches, macerated in water, yield a thick and
abundant mucii (whence the nane of slippery elm), which is used ss a
refreshing drinknfoi colds, aad for emollient plastera, in the place of the marsh
mallow root, which does not grow in the United States. (Mache.) There
are small plante bearing the narne of U. fulva, in Lodd' s’s arboretam

Description, dc. The wahoo elrn is a tree seldom exceeding ³0 st. in height,
with a diameter of 9in.or10in. The flowers do not differ materially from those
of the other elma. The seeds are fringed, and much smaller then those of the
