young branchos is smooth, and beautifully green; but, when old, it becomes
of “ agreyish colom, end is chapped into deep cracks. On cuttin into it,

what are called the sassafras nuts are the fruit of the Lakms Phcheri of the

in t e foresta of Mexico, and even in those of Brazil. Its peculiar foliage,
and the spicy qualities of its berk, render it a prominent object of notice, and
it seems to have been one of the earliest trees of the North American con-
tinent to attract the attention of Europeans. lts character, es an article of
medicine, was at one time so high, that it commanded an extravagant price,

Hc adds thet “ the berk has an agreeable smell, and a fragrant spicy tuate.
The flavour of the root is rnore owerful than that of the branches; and loth
flavour and odour reside in a volatile oil, which is readily obtained from the
bark by distillation. The bark and pith of the young twigs abound witha
pure and delicate mucilage; and in this mucil and the volatile nil all the
medicinal virtues of the trae are contained. he berk and wood were for·

to be attached by insecta, and have a most agreeable odour, which they re-

very little esteem or fuel; and the ‘¹ berk contains a great deal of air, and
snaps while buming like that of the cheatnut.” (Mete.) The most inter-
esting historical recollection connected with this tree is, that it may be said to
have led to the discovery of Amerina, as it was its strong fragrance,smelt by
Columbae, that encouraged him to persevera when his crew mutinied, and
enabled him ιο convince them thet land was near at hand.
