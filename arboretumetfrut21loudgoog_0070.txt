Βειιτίρίίοη, dyc. Deciduous trees, notives ol North America, aud, though
several sorts have been described by botanists, probably all referable to two,
or at most three, species: viz. N. bifldro, N. cltndicsns, and N. tomentdss, the
last two being very nearly sllied. In the caseol hyssope in theseos Fhlxinus
and Quercus, thoresre seeds os several alleged species procured from Americs3
and though plante lrom these may corne up tolerably distinct, we do not con·
sidet that circumstance sufficient to constitute each sort e species. The trees
of this genus are ol' little use sor their timber-3 but the fruit of N. clndicans,
N. tomentbsa, and N. denticuhita, gethered a little before maturity, and pre·
served with sugar, forms an agreeoble conserve, tasting somewhat like cren·
berries. (Nattall Gerr). In Bn'tish gsrdens, two or three ol the sorte occa„
sionslly occur ς hut they arc not common iu collectione. The largest nyssa
that we know of in E land is at Richmond, where, in 1836, it was 45 st.
high. The bees whic have flowered in England have, as far as ne are
sware, onl produced male blossoms3 but, to compensate for the want ol
fruit, the deiuge of all the species of theganus dies off ol un intensely d
scarlet. The differeutsorteare almost elways raised from soeds3 and roffi
with the names os N. denticulhts, N. tomentdsa, N. equitius (N. biddrs), N.
ctndicans, aud N. sylvlrtica, according to Charlwoods Catalogue for 1836,
are sold at lc. a pachet. Plants, iu the London nurseries, are 2⁸. bd. each ς
at Bollwyller tironos, and st New York, from 25 cents to 1 dollur.
