Conuiuae, that, in situations the most favourable sor ship timber (the eald
of Keut, for example), the most prolitsble time to cut oak was at 90 years
old3 as, though the largest scantlings were produced st 130 years’ growth, the

increase in the 40 additional years did mtsguy ι per cent. (Gard. Mag,

rol. xi. p. 690.) ’ In Lord Melvrlle’s Letter ιο arcer Perceaal, Esq„ when tha

they are grown.” (teter, dre, p. 3.) 'l'he .W.T. Bree observes that, as the
oak, like all other trees, varies exceedingly in its growth, according ιο soil and

proof ol its expansion, and ol the consequent growth oi the wood beneath.”
As to the question at what age oalrs should be cut down, so aa to make the
beet return in point ofprofit, this will depend mainly on the demand for oak
timber ol this or that particular siae and quality ιο each neighbourhood.
