wood of willows, whether thet of the trunks end branches, or of the young
shoots, is smeller, harder, tougher, end more compsct end dureble, then that
of willows own in rich moist soils. ln dry soils, els0, the growth of the
plantismuc slower than in moist ones. From these date, it may reason·
ebly be deduced, that, when the object of growing willows is to preserve the
forms which they heve in their natural habitate, these habitate should he imi-
tated ss much es possible; end thet, on the contrary, when the objectis to
escertain what ere species, und wbst only verieties, the soil urrd situation
should be unifonn for all the sorts, of s richer quality, end ofa description
more favoureble for repid growth, then whut occurs to the nverege number of
sorte in e stete of nature. Where bulky produce, either in timber, hranches,
rods, or twigs, is the object, the soil ought to begnod, and the situation end ,
other circumstances favourable to raprd growth, The best situation, when
the object is free end repid growth, is cn the sides of rivers and brooks which
psss through s level country. ln such situations, the timherproclucing kinds

a finer greio, end the hoops and bssket·rods smaller end tougher, then when
the growth hasbeen impelled by sn extraordinarysu ply ofwster. The best
tree willow for thriving in dry uplends is the S. tl ; and the best busket

Propagation. All the willows ure ropogeted by cuttings; though some of
the more rere slpine kinds root with 'fficulty. Some species ropegete very
reedily from seeds; end there een be little doubt thet ¹'ng, und other
similer modes of proppgstion, would be es successful in this genus ss in most
others. The cuttings or plants which are to be grown in nurseries previousl
