but in prepared ground3 except, perhaps, where a few rows may be intro·
duced upon the very brink of a river, or on the top of the banks of ditches,
which form, in rnany instances, the barrier of the wetere, where the soil can
scarcely be dug or otherwise ameliorated. Nothing can be further from being
