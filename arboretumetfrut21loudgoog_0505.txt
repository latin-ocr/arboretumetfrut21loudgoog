was considered as an omen that some great missortrme would belall the
aetion. According ιο Davies’s Celtic Rercarclier aad inpegi irato the Mytho·
logy qt'tlic Μὰ, the ple tree was considered as the next sacred tree ιο
the oali, and erchards di it were always planted near agrove osdruids’ oaks.
This was also favourable to the productiori of the mistletoe, as it grows abun·
dantly on the appla tree‚and might be easily ro ted hy birds, or sny other
accidua} mode of nansporting tlic seed. ille herilli-known ’chorus ol ‘⁴ Hey
derry down,” according ιο Professor Burnet, was a dmidiclchaunt, aig·
nilying, literally, “ ln a circle the oak move around.’' Criminals were tried
under an oak tree; the jadge being laced under the trae, with the jury beside
him, and the culprit placed in a circla made by the chief druid’s wand. The
Saxona also held their natioual maetings under an oak; and the celebrated
confereuce batavam the Saxone and tlie Britons‚ aller the invasion of the
former, was held under the oaks of Dartmoor. 'lhe wood of the oak was
appropriated to tlie most memorable uses: King Arthiu's round table was
. made os it, as was the cradle of Edward ΙΙΙ., when he was bornat Caemarron
Caede ς this sacred wood being choses, in the hope of conciliating the sediuga
ol' the Welch, who still retained the prejudices of their ancestors, the ancient
Britons. It was considered unlucky to cut down any celebrated trec: and
Evelyn gravely relatas a story of two men who cut down the Vicar’a Oak, in
Surrey ; one losing his eye, and the other breaking his leg, soon aster.
