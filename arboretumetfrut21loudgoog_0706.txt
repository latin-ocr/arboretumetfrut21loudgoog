cut off close ιο the tmnli, it is not liable ιο throw out lreah shoots. Accord-
ing ιο German authors, the becch, when treated ae coppice-nond, will ennunue
to send up shoots till it has attained the age ol 30 or lo ears, but ealdorn ιο
a greater age3 and, hence, it is not well adapted either d

removed to its final destination, suffers sevcrel yfrom the removal ol' arry os its
bracchas but, when once established as ah ge, it bears pruning as wellas
