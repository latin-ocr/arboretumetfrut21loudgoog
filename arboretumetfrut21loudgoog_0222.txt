The most vigorousgrowing basket willow is, un uestionshly, S, viminalis;

in a moist soil, it does not always ripen the points of its shoots. S. rubra,
S. Forbyrim, S. decipiens, sud S. stipularis are excellent s ecies, of less
vigorous growth than S. viminalis, which ripen the points oi their shoots

trifindra is nearly ss vigorous ιι S. viminalis. S. H elix, S. vitellino,

uired. Various other sorts might be mentionem but these we consider as by
the most valuable. The soil sor bashet willows ought to be deep, well
drainad, and thoroughly pr ared ; and the situation ought to below, level,
and naturally moist; and,i there is a command of water for irrigation, so
much the better. “ There are few soils,” Sang observes, “that will not bear
