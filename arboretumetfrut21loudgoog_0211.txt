peeredbefore 1111 author’s death. This volume is limited to figuring end describ-
ing the willows ofAustria, aruonnting to 60 101111 01 which engravings are given
01110111 sexes, on extra-large folio platee: the specimens bein of the natural
size,and mostly 110111 lft. 6 in. to ast. in length ; exhibiting both sexes when in
flower, when the leaves are fully expanded, and the female cstkins matured.
This is indeed a splendid work, and only equalled by the small portion which
appeared of the 11110110 Salicum 01 Hoffmann, before mentioned. A great
drawback, however, to the utility of Host’s work is, that tbe author has given
new names to most 01 hie sorte, and has identified but a very few of them
with the kinds described by other 1101111111.

11 1829, llis Gracc the Duke of Bedford had printed, for private circulation,
the Salictum lVohsmreure, in which 160 species 111 figured and described3 sll
of which, with the exce 1101 011 very few, were at that time alive in the
salictum 11 Woburn. he engravings are small, but good ; the descriptione
are chiefly taken from Smith, but are partly original, by Μ1. Forbes, the Duke
01 Bedford's gardener. “We have in the Selicium 1110611111111,η Sir W. J.
Hooker observes, “ 1 standard set of figures of all the British, amongst many
exotio, species; which, together with those 01 theEnglislt Botany, do, it must he
1011111111, give to the British naturalist an advantage over all that Continental
authors have publisbed anthe subjectg and to them I refer in every instance,
and vvitb great satisfaction. The arrangement 01 the species in the 1111111111
is due to the botanical skill and knowledge 01 Μ1. Forbes, head gardener at
Woburn‚ which His Gracc has fully hcknowlcdged5 and that department does
him great credit.” §aa Fr, i. p. 416.)

The willows of North America were, es far as they vvere known in 1814,
described by Pursh, with thc assistance of Mr. G. Anderson, who had iu culti·
vation several rare species from that country; and some species have subse·
quently been added by Nattall. Since then, Dr. Barratt of Middletown, Con·
111111111, bas undertakcn to describe all the willows grown in America, whether
indigenous or 1110111, amounting to 100,a conspectus of which hchas sent to Sir
W. J. Hooker, arranged in 9 groups, chiefly the sante as those of Μ1. Borrer.
Cuttings of 11101101 those 10010111 have been received hy the Duke osBed-
ford, and planted in his salictum st Woburn‚ where many of them are alive.
Some other particulare respecting them will be found in the Campaniae to tlte
Batauical Magaziue, vol. i. .17. As Dr. Barratt'e descriptione must neces-
sarily, in great part, be t en from dried specimens, it appears to us very
doubtful how far they will be of use to the Europcan toraniam 11111Ι there can
be 10 doubt as to the benefit which will result from the introductron of all
these sorte into British gardens, because there they may be compared in a
living state with the kinds we already possess.

Lightfoot‚ in his Flora Scotico, paid considerable attention to willows; but,
according to Sir J. E. Smith, ‘¹ he laboured at the subject with hesitation and
mistrust, from 11 opinion 01 the species being confounded by arose-impreg-
nation.'' Lightfoot‚ and his contemporary Hudson, therefore, Sir James adds,
have hardly enurncrated a fourth part of the native willows of our island.
'l'he cultivation of willows, with a view to the determination of their specific
1111111111, was, according to Sir J. E. Smith, first taken u with vigour end
effect by Jamee Crowe, Esq, F.L.S., 01 Lakenham, near orwicb, “a most
excellent British botanist,’' about the end 01 the last century; and Sir James
E. Smith, writing in leae, says that he had laboured full 30 years in the

study 01 willows in Μ1. Crowe’s gardan, which contained all the sorts that
could then be procurcd in 11101151101ξ111111. (Reet's Cyri.) Μ1. Georgo
