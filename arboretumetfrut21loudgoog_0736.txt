The nurserymen in the south os Devonahire, and in Jerscy, generally pay ,
rnore attention to the sweet cheatnut, as a fruit tree, than the nurseymen in
the neighbourhood of London. There iasaid to be atree of a very superior
variety in a garden in St. Peter’s parish, Jersey, from which, it is believed,
yplpnts arel propagated)in Saunders's Nuraery, in that island. (See Gerd.

The varietiespctdtivated in Franco lor the table are divided into two kinds,
viz, let chitaiguet and let nument,¹ the former being to the latter what the
crebis to the apple. The latter are,olcourse,much preferred, being larger,
more larinaceous, and aweeter. When roasted, they have also a rich creamy
flavour, and an aromatic odour, in which the common chcatnuts are quite ,
deficient. The best marrona sold in Paria are the marrona de Lyons ς and
the best kinds of the common chestuut are ι - La chataigne de Bois, the
fruit of which is small, will not keep, and is ol little flavour; and the tree
forms the principal coppicewood in the neighbourhood of Paria: la Chi-
teigne ordinaire, ol which the fruit is rather better, and the tree more
vigemus, and a greater bearer: laChlttaigne pourtalonne, the fruit of which
is very fine, and produced in great abundante: la Chitaigne printanieoe,
tlte fruit of which has no other merit than that of being produced very early
in the season: la Chitaigne verte du Limouain, which produces very large
excellent fruit, which will keep a long time, and the tres of which preserves

· its leaves een much lon er thanfany of the other varieties: and la cht-
taigne ex ade, the fruit ol which is the best of all the common chestnuta

lor the table; but the tree, which is low, with spreading brancbes,is auch

an abundant bearar, that it soon exhausta itaell.

Description, dc. The chestnut, under lavourable circumstances, is a tnag-
nificent trec, though it never attalus a height, or diameter of head, equal to
