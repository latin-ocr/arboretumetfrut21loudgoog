of not absorbing water, and surpass the sabota of other wood, except

only those made of the velunt, which ιιι, of course, much dearer, from the
demand for that wood for other purposer. The consumption of beech sabota
in the mountainous districts of Franco, according to Bosc, is immense. ‘⁸ They
aremade of wood which has been cut onlya few months, and is, conae ently,
nearly green; but which the manufacturers dry rapidly, with the smviir'e ro·
duc'ed by buming the chips which are formed in making the ιιιοιι. inis

smolre, containing a great deal ofmoisture, or steam, along with the beat, does
not crock the sabota which are exposed to it; while the pyroli eous acid
which is evolved (and which is produced in agrester quantity by ewood of
thebeech than by thet of any other trec) netrates the sabot, and rendere
it not liahle ιο ιι attached by insecta. he sabota ιο treated are always of

the roliers of all kinds of wood used in those cottages in Scotland and lrelend
which are without ceilings. At St. E‘denne, in France, the wood of the
beecb is used ιο make the bundles ιο ιιοιι ιιιι knives that are aold all over
France at 2 sous apiece, and which are call Eustache Dubois, from the

felled with what we before stated from Mathews (p. roob), and which is, doubt- .
less, the result of bis own experience3 viz. that tbe timber of the beech soon
decays, if it be not immediately dried, or immersed in water onita being cut
down. Beudrillart states that, in England, the beecb, aster being cut in the
beginning of summer, and suffered to he a year, is sawn into planks, &ct and
that these are submitted to the llame of the cbips and f twood of the trec,
till the aurface of the wood is aomewhat chorrad ι and at aher this it is im·
mersed in water for lor 5 ιιοιιιι. The cabinet-mahero, the same audior
states, prevent it from being attached by worma, by varnishing it, or by keeping
it for a certain time in boihng water, or in hoiling oil. On enquiry ru various
directions, we have not been able to have the Fruch reporta of the English
raetice confirmedp but we find that there is at presente very great demand

ιιι practice has not yet found its way into Scotland. ln Hampshire, we are
informed by Mr. Davis, the beecb is a good deal used for barn lloors; and,
where these are kept free from damp, by ι thorough ventilation underneath
them, they are said to last many ζιιιι. ·

Aa Fael, the wood of the beec is superior to that of most other trees. lt
is consumed to an immense extent for this purpose both in France and Ger-
many; but more especially in Paria, where there are more open lires than in
any other Continental city. lt is considered to burn rather rapidi ς ιιι it
throws out ι great deal of beat, and makes a clear bright fleme. he green
woodis generally preferred to that which is dry, ιιιιιιιι it burna slower,
though it does not give out ιο much beat ς and hence, in many places, the trec
is frequently cut down in the summer reason. According to t e experimenta
