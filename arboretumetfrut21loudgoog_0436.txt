along the margins of rivers, to keep up the banls byits numerous creeping

As an ornamental trae, much cannot be eald in favour of the alder- Du
Hamel remarks that its verdureis agreeable,and its shade duse3 and that
its leaves, like those on all planta which grow by water, remain on longer in
the autumn than those of deciduous trees which prefer dry situations. ln shel-
tered places, young elder trees fr uently retain their leaves till January.
Du Hamel observes that, as cattle wi never touch the leaves of the elder aa
long aa they can get anythin else to eat, it is a good tree for parire,and
also for hedges 3 and headda that it will form very good avenues in situations
ex sed to cattle. Aa an object for the landseape-painter, the leaves of the
al erdo notfall into linemassesy and they pear too uniformly distributed
over the entire head of the tree. Nevertheeas, as Gilpin observes, it is a

fully agrees with Mr. Gilpin in his commendation of the alder. It is always
associated in our minda, he says, “with river somery, both of tlut tranquil
description most frequently to be met with in the vales of Eugland, and with
that of a wilder and more stirring cast, which is to be found among the glena
and deep ravines of Scotland. ln very many instantes, we have seen it put
on so much of the bold resolute character of the oali, that it might have been
mistaken for that tree, but for the intense depth of its green hue. The Mole
