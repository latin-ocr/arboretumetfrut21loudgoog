The following particulata respectio this kind are derived from Eug.
Fl. and Sal. Woh, chiefly from the lonner :- Lesves elliptic-oblong,
murex, somewhat toothed, with a ctirred pomt3 glaucone, sdky,
and veiny baueath. Stipules minute. Stem prostrate, with elongated
straight branches. Orary stalked, ovate, silky. Styles shorter
than the stigmas. (Sal. Wob, p. 163.) A native of Britain, iu moist
and dry moors, heaths, and sandy situations; llowering in May.
Root woody‚ rather long and slender. The stems compone an

and also in the Goldworth Arboretum. “ S. prostrhta and S. repens?
Dr.Johnston observes, “ have been confidently pronounced varieties
of the same species by some botanists of descrsed eminence, while
others, not less eminent, consider them ‘tottdly distinct? Both
plants are familiar to me; sud Ι cannot hesitste to rank myself with
those who are ol the latter opinion. S. prostrdto is the larges species,
