iorni on the summit a sheas-like head, of regular repertione and admirable
beauty.” (Ihid.) The white alm is a native ο1 orth America, from Nova
Sectis to Georgia, a distance of 1200 miles3 but it isfound in the greatest
pei'iection in Lowar Canada, New Brunswick, Nora Scotia, the north-eastern
section ο1 the United States, and Genessee in the state of New Yorli. The
white elin delights in lew humid situations ; soils such as, in the northern states,
arc called interval landa. ln the middle statas,itgrows,insimilar situations,
and on the berder ο1 swamps. West of the mountains‚ it abounds in all the l'er·
tile bottoms watered by the great rivers that swell the Ohio and the Mississippi,
particularly on the brinlr of the rivers, where its base is inundated at the rising
oi thesram in the spring. The wood is used sor the same urposes as the
European elm,but it ts decidedly inferior in strength and har ness; it has also
less compactness, aud splits more readil . The barli is said to be easily de·
tached during eight months of the year. doaked in water, and rendered supple
bypcunding, it is separated into shreds, or ribands, which are used, in the
northern states,sor wearing into scats for common chairs, as rushes are in
England. (Mutuus.) This trec was introduced into Eugland iu 1752, by
hir. lamas Gordon; though, as Martyn observes, no notice is taken ο1 it, or
ο1 any other American eim, in the edition ο1 Miller's Dalionary which was
published sixteen years afterwards. The three varieties have douhtless existed
ru tbe arboretntn at Kew, aad, probably, in the grounds at Syon; hut theg are
net now to be found in either ο1 these collectione. The only plants uhic wc
hare seen are those in the Horticultural Society’s Garden3 where there are
several hom test. to soh. in height. They bear a general resemblance to
U. montana, both in their naked and clothed state; but they are readily
distinguished from that species hythe roughnsss ο1 their barli. The leaves,
sleo,sre more pointed, longer in ropertion to their breadth, have longer foot-
stalks,and are ol' sfiner green. ll'he so closely resemble other trees, marked,
in the Horticultural Society’s (iarden, U. hispanica, as scarcely, if at all, to
be distinguishable from them. Michaux sent seeds ο1 this clm to France in
1807,from which several thousand plsnts wereraised; and of which,aecord' to
the hbaeeca Da Homel, there are very fine specimens at Trianon, where ey
are distinguished from all ether elms by the superior beauty of their leaves.
Cebbett inl'orms us that he imparted a immi& ο1 alm saed from the horders
oi Lake Oetacis, which was gathered rom a trae that had a clear straight
stem wit. high, before it began to ramify; but that these secde, from having
been put together before they were thoroughly dried‚ had sermented on the
passage,and not one ever came up. (Woodlcnds, dvc, p. 241. and 242.) ln
the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, there is a tree which, in 1828, was 2511. sin.
high, with a trunlr 'lim in diameter. Price ο1 planta in the London nurseries,
