(lreelra asterwards called the walnut tree Car on, on account 01 the heavineas
01 the head producedAE its strong amell. en the walnut was introduced

into Europe is alto er uncertaint but it was cultivated by the Romans
before the death 01 the Emperor Tiberius, and is supposed to have been
brought froin Graece by Vitellius. Strabo informans at in Rome, at one
time, tables of the wood sold at a higber price than those 01 citron. Ovid
wrote a little poem, entitled De Nuce, by which it appears that then, as now,
walnnts were knoclted down from the trees by boys; and that, at marriages,
walnuts were thrown by the bride and bridegroom among the children
who surrounded them; a ceremony which was instituted to show that
the bridegroom had lest off hia boyish amusements 3 or, perhaps, to signify
that the bride waa no longer a votary 01 Diana. (See p. 1430.) Hence, pro·
bably, is derived the French word sor nu tiela, der nocer. ln France, at the
festival 01 tbe Rosiere at Seleucy, in the department 01 the Oise (see p. 792),
in the sixth century, it is directed that an offering be presented to the
young maid who is crowned, composed of walnuts and other fruita 01 the
country. The walnut trec isnow to be met with in every part 01 Europe,
as far north as Warsaw3 but it is nowhere sofar naturalised as toproduce
itself spontaneously from seeds. ln Britain, it has been iu cultivation from
the earliest period 01 botanical history, and, in all probability, since the
time 01 the Romans. It ripens its fruit in tine seasons, in the neigh-
bourhood 01 Edinburgh, aa a standard; and it lives against a wall as far
north as Dunrobin Castle, in Sutherlandshire. lt is much cultivated, in some
parts 01 Italy, France, Gernrany, and Switaerland, aa a read-ride tree.
Michaux says that it is more abundant in those parts 01 France which lie
between 45 and 48⁰, than in any other part 01 Europe; and that the fruit,
the oil, and the wood may be considered as forming, in that 'on, some 01
the rincipal branches 01 commerce. This corresponds with'lvffiat is stated
by slve! n. “Burgundy,” says that author, “abounds with walnut trees,
where tliey stand in the midst 01 dl wheat landa, at sixty and a hundred
leet distance; and sofar are they ¹rom lurting the crop, that they are loolred

(Hanter'r Eaelyn, p. 168.) “The Ber trass,'’ he adds, “which extends
from 1101ἀὲ1011ςῶ0) 1100001111, is all panted with walnuta.” (ibid, vol. i.

p At dillerenl¹ periods, there hasbeen agreat dearth 01 the wood 01 tbis tree in
France, where, as in Eugland, in time 01 war, it was much in demand 101
gun-stoclm. lt is a remarkable fact in the history 01 this tree, that, in the
winter 01 1709, the greater part 01 the walnut trees 01 Europe, and more
especially 01 Switzerland,¹ France, and Germany, were killed3 nr so far in-
jured, aa to render it advisable to fell the trees. The Dutch, at that time,
foreseeing the scarcity 01 walnut timber that was likely to ensue, bought up
all the trees that they could procura, in ever direction, and sold them again,
according to the demand, 101 many years a rwards, at a greatly adraneed
price. ln the year 1720, au act was assed, in France, to prevent the ex-
portation 01 walnut timber, on pain olconfiscstion, and payment 01 a fine 01
3,0001ivrea. Α great many walnut trees were, at that nme, planted in the
royal demesnes. 10 18081110 manufacture 01 muslets required about laona
trees yearly. 10 consequence 01 this, a great many plantatione were made by
individuals; and a prize was given 101 tbc cultivation 01 the tree by the
Society 101 the Encouragement 01 Arts, in Paris. We have been informed
by M. Michaux, in a letter dated December, 1834, that in 1818 he formed a
nursery 01 between five and six acres, 101 government, in the Bois de
