Varia-tier. In consequence 01 U. glabra ripenihg seeds in different parts 01
angant, many varieties bave been raised 110111 it, most 01 which are distin·
guished by great rapidity 01 growth. From the specimens that have been
sent to us from the Canterbury, Huntingdon, and other nursaries, and also
from the trees in tbe Horticultural Society's Garden, it is difficalt to de-
termine, in every case, whether the varieties 01 U. (m.) glabra are not nearer
to U. montana or U. amaricans, than to that sub-species; and, in some in-
stances, they ap ear to partake ol the character 01 U. campestris and' U.
(c.) suberdsa. T. A. Knight, Esq., informs us that lrorn sceda 01000 variety

01 U. (m.) glabra, viz. the Downton elm, which were ripened in the cold

climate 01 t at part 01 Shropshire, he ‘⁴ raised plants which are so pcrloetly
similar to the U. subcrbsa, and which approximate so nearly to the character
ol' the U. glabra, that ” he does ‘¹ not doubt but that the U. compatris, U.
subcrdsa, U. glabra, and three or 10111 other varieties which '' he has “ seen
in different parts 01 England, are all varieties only 01 thesaure species.”
