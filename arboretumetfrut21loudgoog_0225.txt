Every basiet, according ιο the Scotch and German mode of construction,
consists of two perts; the main riba, or rincipal parts of the frameworh
of the structure3 and the filling in, or wattled part, or web. The principal
ribs, in common baslets of a roundish form, are two: a vertical rib, or hoop,
the upper part of which is destined ιο form the handle, and a horizonte]
boop, or rim, wbich is destined to support all the subordinate ribs, on
which the wanda arewattled. The two main ribs are first bent to the re·
qrrired form, and made fast at their extremities b nails or wire. They
are then joined together in their proper pontion, the one intersecting the
other3 and they are afterwards narled together, or tied by wire, at the points

of intersection. Theuperation of wgttling is next commenced‚ by taking the
