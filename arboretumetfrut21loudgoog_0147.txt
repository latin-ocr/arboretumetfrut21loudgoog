The Chipstead Elm, in Kent,tigured by 811011, was 60 11. high, and contained
16811. 01 timber. Its trunlr was covered with ivy, and the trec appeared very
luxuriant when Mr. Strutt made hie drawing; but, in the spring of 1836, ss
we were informed by J. Polbill, Esq, the trec did not put forth its leaves, and
it stood throughout the following summer a leadess trunk. The elms at

inscribed to the memo 011110 highly valued friends 01 the possessor in 1830,
who was the Bisbop of urbam and whom, Mr. Strutt observas, “ it was de·
lightful to contemplate wanderiug, in his 90th year, amidst shadee with which
he was almost coeval, anti which in fresbness and tranquillity afforded most
tuiteble emblema 01 his own green and venerable old aoe.” ln heland, tbe

111101 named, we think belong to U. campestris. Naar Arklow, at Shelton‚

'l'ne diameter 01 the head, ta en from the extremraes 01 the lower brancbes

exceeded 34 yards ; but in the end 01 that year the two principal arms fell freni
the 1111011 in one night, apparently from their own weigbt, as the weather was

ectly calm. The timber contained in these branches alone sold 101· 5 guinem.

this situation the tree continued till the winter of 1776, when a violent storto
tore up the whole by tlte roots, with a great mass 01 soil and rock adhering to
