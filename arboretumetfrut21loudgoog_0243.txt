Plentmm ol' Lmureus, aud the Species Plantarnm ol Willdenow, ha‘ve tlre
synonymes of. other authors added to them.

ln our App. iir. to the genus satir will be found the characters ol Koch’s
10 different groups; and under each the names and synonymes ol the species
which he has assigned to thern.

From the perusal of Koch’s observatione, two points, we think, will be ren·
dered clear to the botanical reader :-l. That the mode of arran 'ng the
sections according to the character ol the leaves, adopted ογ sll the innaean
school previously to the time ol Wahlenberg, is altogether defective3 and,
2. That the a stem of throwing the species into natural groupa, as adopted hy
thlenherg, ines, Koch, and Borrer‚ is the true one. Being ourselves of
this opinion, the only question that remained for us to decide was, whether
we shoutdrfotlow Koch or Borrer in the arrangement of the species described
in thia work aa in a living state in British gardana.

The excellence oi Koch’s system was strongly impressed on our mind
from the moment that we saw rt developed in Dr. Lindley's Spncpris ostie
Britiri Flora ,· and, if we could have clsased all the numerous sorts of willows
in the salictum at Woburn, ancl in the Hackney arboretum, under Koch’s ten
groups‚ in a manner satisfactory to ourselves‚ we should have done so: the

at once, in the most kind and liberal manner, classed tire sorte conmined in the
&hum Wobumenae in the 22 gvoupa into which, with the exception of a lew
sorts, they are thrown in the lo lowing article. Mr. Borrer's knowledge
ol' this genus is universally known. He pensasses au extensive collection of
living planta, which he has cultivated for some years; aad, as Sir W. J. Hooker
remarks, “ No one has ever studied the willows, whether in a growing or a
driled ειοῑὶ, more deeply, or with a less prejudiced mind.” (Brit. 111, ed. 3.,

Our es were chieli drawn lorus hy Mr. Sowerby‚ from specimena received .
from e salictum actionum Abbey3 in the single instance ol the S. caprea,
reduced from Host’s work3 and nearly all tbe remainder, including all the 28
ffies of leaves ol' the natural siae, by the kind perrniasion oi the Duke ol

ford, have been copied from the Sabotam Wobumensc.

lt will thus ap that our article, lengthy and elaborate as it is, ia, in a
botanical point ο view, chielly to be considered aa matter lor a history of
willows, rather than as a complete history in itaelf. Such a history, indeed,
ean onl he prepared hy a botanist who has had all the cies in a living state
under ' eye for several years; and who has appli to them one general
principle ol' nonunt or comparison. Till this is done, not only with the genus
suis, but with every other genus of which there 'are numerous speciea,a
dedded imperiection must ever be sound in works like the present, ιιι which

the apecific characters are necessarily made up of descriptions given ογ dil-

ferent individuale, at different times, and in

living plants collected from their native habitldikiedtitecrkuirtdirisiividmitlfdiiii

advantage that would result to hotany and arboriculture frome national
arboreturn; in which not only all the species and varieties should be col·
lected, but also both the sexes of all the kinds that have the male and female
ssowers on different lants. Suchan arboretum„onasufficientlylargescale,
and properi msnffieri, would form a living standard of reference, both for the
botanistan thec tivator.
