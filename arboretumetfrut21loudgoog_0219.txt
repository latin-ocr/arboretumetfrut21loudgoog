soil pressed lirmly 1011, more especially 01 110 lower extremity. he 1000011

why the lower end 01 the cutting 11 cut directly across, and not slopiag like

the upper end, is, that it may form aa epual callosity all round 11, and, con·
0

sequentl ,1111011 0010110110οΙ number roots from that callosity on every
side. he reason why the cutting is placed upright is, that the 10011 may be
principally formed at 110 lower extremity3 because that makes a haadsomer
and more symmetrieal plant than when the roots are protruded partly from
the lower end, 01111 partly from the side. lt is found from 01111οῐ10000, that,
when 0 cutting is put in ina sloping direction, roots are protruded nearly
equally through all 11101 part that is buricd in the ground, unless the soil has
been more closely pressed 'nst one part than 0110111011 10 which case
the roots will there beprotru edin greater abundance; and, if the soil has
notbeeu pressed 10 the lower extremity‚ it will probably produce no roots
01 011 there, but 101. The upper extremity 01 the cutting 10 001 in a sloping
direction, merely 10 throw 011 the rain. When willows 010 10 110 planted
where they 010 finally 10 remain, cuttings may be made 01 1110 110-1011110111
wood, about 211. long, and cut in a sloping directioa at 110111 ends. The
0111011101εο0101000101111011010011-0111 wood is, that the plants produced
are more vigemus, which is not always desirable in planta that are 10 110 trans·
planted, on account 01 their greater bulk, and the consequent expense 01
their removal. The cuttings 01 the two-years-old wood should 110 inserted

aad 01 inserting them, is more particularly necessary when a plantation 01

tiags 01 the smaller lunda 01 willows, and especially 01 those kinds which are
somewhat difficult to atrike, should be planted in a sandy soil, in 0 shady

should have their cuttings formed 01 1110 growing wood with the leaves on;
and, 01101 being planted in saud, they should be covered with a hand-glass.
The best season 101 puttin in cuttings 01 the winter's wood is the autumn,
in consequence 01 which 1101111111 swell during the winter, and are ready to

The principal willon which propagates 111011 by seeds in.Europe is the S.
ciprea, and itsv numerous allied kinds. The seeds 010 small and black, aad
enveloped in a tul of cottony matter. They are ripe in May, 01 early in
June; aad they are speedily dispersed by the wind. if they fall 111 soil
meist and shaded from the sun, or if a heavy showcr 01 1010 happen 0000
afterwards, they will spring ap in three acels, aad produce plants 310. 01
