Anderson, F.L.S., bad at that time a collection at West llam, in Esses,
which he was studying lor the same purpose; as had Edwnrd Foreter, Esq,
st Walthamstow, and which has since been removed to Woodlord, in Essem
and W. Borrer, lieu, at Henfield, in Suseex. At Lenes, in the same corrmy,
Mr. Woollgar bad extensive willow grounds, etudied the speeies very assidu-
ousl , and communicated several facts to Sir J. E. Smit . subsequently,
a coiection was made by His Grace the Duke ο1 Bedlord at Woburn, which
appears to heve been the most extensive till then made in England3 sud the¹
nest greatest number of sorte is in the arboremm ο1 Messes. Loddiges, at
Haciney. In all these salictums, vve ore inlorrned by those who have ex-
amined thern, the plante were placed too closely to ther to attain their
characteristic form and siae. At Wobum, the p ts were, till 1836,
crowded together in a very limited sace, which necessarily presented
their habite from being properly studi ι but they have since been trans-
planted, and allowed more room; though they are not, even now, as it
appears to us, in a situation either sufficiently large, or adequately ex·
posed to the inlluence of the sun and the air. A few specics ο1 wrllowe have
atteined the siae ο1 trees in the Horticultural Societ ’s Garden; but, aa
far as we are aware, there is no extensive collection ο1 lull-grown willows any
where either in Britain or on the Continent. Most of the ltinds id the
Wobum salictum are in the arboretum at Flitwiclr House, at Goldworth,

ln sn economical point of view, eoarcely anythiug was added to our know-
ledge of the culture and uses of the willow since the time ο1 the Romens;
till the slight notices of the uses of willows given by Ray, and afterwards by
Evelyn. The liret systematis essay on the subject appears to have been
written by Dr. Wallrer, about the latter end os the laet century, though not
publiehed till 1812. lt is entitled salicetum anthemunta! Hister-pand

promised to be described in a future vo nme, were cultivated by the author in

is gardan at colinton, near Edinburgh.

when our exclusion from the Continent, in consequence ol the eontinned war,
led to the formation ol plantatione ethome. The Society ο1 Arte, directing
their attention to the subject, have, at various times, offered premiume 1οι the
