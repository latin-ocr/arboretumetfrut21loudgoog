(Borrer in Eng. Bot. Suppl.) The late Mr. G. Anderson, who distin iahed
and named the species, discovered it near Oarlislaiu1809; and ound it
asterwerds in Fifeshire and other counties of Scotland3 and by the Thamar,
near Windaor, Reading, &a The female has been observed, also, near
Nuthurst, Sussex. (Id.) The following description ia taken from that
given b Mr. Forbes in· Sal. Wod. :—‘ A bushy shrub or low tree; flowering
