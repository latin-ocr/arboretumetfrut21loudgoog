more flexible, but donot possess so much toughness, hardness, and durability.
Where the gramis twisted, no timber is so well adopted for posts, either us
house-buildr or in setting up mills, engines, or large machinas No wood
laste longer iissre it is subject to be alternately vet and dry ς and oalt piles
have been known to endure many centuries. Shingles, pales, end latha
last longer of thie wood than of any other ; and csaks, and every other descrip-
tion of cooper’s work, are most durable, and bestadspted for containing wines,
ales, and other liquors, when they are made of oalt. Oak timber is perticu-
larly esteemed for the spoles ol wheels, for which the. small slew-growing
oalr of mountainous districtsis greatly preferred to the more rapid-growing
and larger oalr of the velleys. Oalrs of from 15 to 30 years' growth make
the most dureble poles. The young trec, when from ast. ιο lost. high, makes
excellent hoops, which, Evelyn says, we ought to substitute for those of hezel
and ash, as they are sis times more durable: it also makes tlte very best welk-
tuguriolis, and very good haudles ιο οοιιειε’ whips. Of the roota, Evelyn says,
were formerly madehalle to daggers, hsndles ιο lmives, tobacco-boxes‚ mathe-
meticsl instrumente, tablets for artists to paint on instead of cauvass, and elegant
camleted joiners’ worlr. Oslt wood, every one knows,is referred before all
others for shipbuilding, in the temperate regions of both hemispheres. The

Q. pedunculhta (the chene blanc ο the French), from its toughness, does not

splrnter when it is struck by a cannon ball, and the hole made hyla ball is con-

sequently much easier ιο p ug up; but it is said, on the other and, that this
species, when it is grown iu good soil, somewhat moist, contains a great deal of
white or sap wood, which soon οοῗοε ιο decey, and, proeeeding repidly, ulti-
mately destroys the heart wood. ( ich. 0bs.,&c., p. 44.) Secondat (Mirrada
flam, p. 3.) attributes the proHerty of not splintering, when gierced with
bullets, to the wood of Q. sessili ὄιος which, he says, the Englis had agreat
deal of formerly, and valued highly for the construction of ships, and which he
describes as a tree attaining a prodigious size aud height, and onlysucceeding
in good soil: but, as these characters belong more to Q. pedunculata than ιο
esseillius, at least accordingto Willdenow, Bosc, and other authors,
we conclude that Secondat has here mistehen the nenne of the kind ιο
which he has assigned these properties. The best oalt for ship purposes,
according ιο Jaume St. Hilaire, is that which is grown in the south of
France ; and the best ships in the world, he says, are built in Toulon, or in
Spain. The worst oalt for shipbuildlng, according to this author, is that sent
to Britain from Dantzic, and other ports of the Baltic. The barlr of both
species is indiscrinsinately used for tanning, though that of Q. sessilillbra is
