ned in the different species. Whoever has seen an acorn of the common
{ritish oak would be at no loss to detect an oak oi any species whatever,
provided he saw its fruit; whereas in the case ol many genera, such aa
Pyros, for example, no man, not a botanist, who had seen an appla or a pear,
would recognise as species ol the same genus those trees which bore fruit
like the mountain aab. ln short, the mnus Quercus may be es easily detected
at first sight by its fruit, as the Abietinae or the Legumindsae are hy theirs.
The aemma ol differem speeies differ chiefly in dre largeness or smallness,
ro bness or smoothnese, of their calyx, or cup3 and in their being sessile or

The oak which attains the greatest magnitude is Q. pedunculdta3 and this
species also appears ιο be of the greatest duration, both in respect ιο its
life, end to ita timber. ln ordinary soils and situations, no species of
oak attains to maturity in much less time than a century. There are, also,
few trees which, when raised from seed, erc so long in producing inritr

All the species of oak ush up shoots from the co rwhen cut down, but

of leeding their cattle on it, but to attract lawns and other animale from the

whole nacta dilorest are destroy . The roots os the trees, however,
generally remain uninjured; and those of the oaks, which spread bori-
sontally, frequently send up shoots which produce acorna, when only two
or three leet above the ground. These miniature oaks have been found by
travellers, who, unable otherwise ιο account sor their appearance, hare
fancied them distinct specics; but as their acorna, when soen, blichanx ob-
serves, ‘⁴ have produced ataproot, like common acorna, without suckers or
stoloniferous roots, it is not likely that there are any oaks in Amerina
which bave naturally trailing stems.’' Hr’st. der Chiam, p. 5.) We have
