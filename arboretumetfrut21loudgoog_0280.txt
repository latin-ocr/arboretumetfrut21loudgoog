Propagab'on aad eatae. Itis justly remarhed by Mr. Gorrie, that 11 adds

much tothe value of the salix alba, that its propagationaud culture are of
' the most simple description3 and that it will grow luxuriautly in most
soils where other trees make but slow progreas. According tn Sang, it will
tluive well in high and drygrounds; and, if planted in the grove manner,
perhaps no other plantation, except 16161166, would give 60 quiok a return

01 the trouble an expense of plantiug. “ It is au excellent cop ce-wood, ·
grows extremely fast, and 16 very valuable. Itis likewise an 6106116111 nurae

l had to encounter no little obloquy 1111 my presumption. The result, how·
ever, has been favourable; the plaute ou the high ground come away boldly,
und iu the hollow, which 16 only about 5011. above the level of the sea, the
Huntingdon willow has made astonishing progress: at tlt. above the ground,
several of the 11666 already measure 46 m. m circumferente, and in height
from 55 st. 10 tofta giving fully lin. in diameter, aud dst. in altitude, for
every year they have been iu the soil. The lanta were aboutdft. in height,
rand 1 in. 111 diameter, at planting. Pruning iias been regularly attended to,
all large aspirin branches having been removed, and the leading shoot and
nunterous smali side shoots encouruged, sor the purpose of producing suf-
ficient foliage to elaborate the sap. One peculiar advantage in the culture of
this valuable tree is, 11161111 planting it, rooted plante are not absolutely re·
quiaite. l have found shoots of from 61110811. long, and 6110111216. in
diameter, 66666611 better than rooted planta: they require to be put in from

roots sent out in such soil afford abundant nourishment, and 6110016 616 pro·

account of the present state 01 this 1601611011, 10 years having elapeed since
the above was written, he informs us 1161,1006101161,1836,1161001666ῳ611161,
and measured several of the semetreee, of which the dimensione were taken
in December, 1825, and found that they had increased very considerably in
growth. “ One tree now (iu 1836) mensures in circumferente, at 1 11110111 the
ground, 711111, two trees 68 111.,611110116116667111. The av egirt of those
which grow near the rivulet is from 62 in. to 68 in.; but nosiividcn stand fur·
ther from the stream are 66161161. The measurable solid wood, above 6111. in
diarnet'er,is30 solid feet ou each 01 two of the largest trees3 and 25 solid
l'eet on each of two other trees. Two trees have letely been blowu overb
the wind, which stood beyond the reach of the stream; and 111666 1066661611,
11160116 7611, aud the 0111618011, in length. On cutti up the wood of
these 1166611110 boards, it showcd a beautifully waved bir ’s-eye appearance,
and it readily acquired a smooth glosay surface. These treet have now been
planted at years ; aud the largest one, which is that firstmentioned above, as
1111103711111, mensures, within a scansion, 1 in. in diameter for every year 11

ortion to the extent 01 the circumference. The aolidmeasurable wood in the
iargest tree averages at the rate of 1 st. 3111. 101 every year it has been planted.
Upou the whole‚’' concludes Mt: (101116, 111611 who uo man' 16 amore
competent judge on this subject, ‘⁴ l continue of opinion that few trees cau
come in competition with the 1161111 alba, for rapidity of growth, elegante 01
