and very ancient; the old oulen ulpit, also, which now adorna the new
structurewns the donatiou of Sir Julius Caesar, nn. 1621. The ridi carvings
ur oak which ornamented the King's room in Stirling Castle were executed
about 300 years ago, and are msny of them still in good preservation in the
collectione of the curicus. In digging away the foundation of the old Savoy
Pelace, London, which was built upwards of 650 yeers since, the whole of
the pileo, many of which were of nali, were found in a state of perfect
soundness, as, also,was the planliing which covered the pile heads. (Thedgcld.)
Buffon mentions the soundness of the pilea of thebridge which the eror
Τ 'an built across the Danube; one of which, when taken up, was ound
to petrified ιο the depth of three quarters of an inch, but the rest of the
wood was little different from its ordinary state. And of the durability ofoah
timber, the oldest wooden bridge of which we have any account, vir. that one
famous from its defence by Horatius Cocles, and which ex'nted at Rome in
the reign of Ancus Martius, 500 years before Christ, might be given aa

unoouth stari‘nge which nonlined the waterway and so ly disligured
old London Bridge, were some of them of oah3 end 1 [ fessor Burnet]
bave a specimen of one, which is far from being in a rotten atate: aud the
still older piles on which the bridge piers restcd were also in n very strong
and sound condition: nay, those stelles which it is said the ancient Britons
drove into the bed of the Tharnen to impede the progresa of Julius Caesar,
near Oatlands, in surrey, some of which have been removed for examinatiou,
have withstood the destroyer time nearly 20⁰0 years.'’ (Amen. Quer, fol. 7.)
ln cambden’s time, the place where these stokes were found was called
Cowey Stakes. ln the Venulo Montanum, vol. ii. pl. 7., is s shetch of
an old wooden church at Greenetead, near Ongar, the ancient Aungare,in
Easex. The inhabitants have a tradition, that the corpsc of a deed hiugouce

ceptacle for the body of St. Edmuud (who was alain Α. n. 946), and subse·
