female plant is the more desirable kind for the object of the cultivator. There
cau be no doubt that the funale of every speciesis the more vigorous-growing
plant; and, consequently, where timber or coppicewood, hoo s, or rods for
thalarger kinds of basketworlr‚ are the produce wanted, the israele of the
species to he cultivated ought to be preferred, however difficult it may be,
in the present state of the nursery culture of willows, to procura panta
the sex of which is known. On the other hand, as we have before observed,
when tongh‚ yet delicate, rods are reguired for basiet-making, not only the
liner-growing species, but the males o these species, ought to be selected. lt
ought also to he borne in mind, aa e generd principle, that willows, to be of ,
any use, either as bnslret-rods, hoops, poles, or timber trees, urrist annually
ripen their choors, and that, in cold climates, this cannot be done where
they are grown in soil which is abundantly supplied with water lurein the
amaon. Hence the colder the climate, the drier should be the soil3 on
account of the necessity of perfectly ripening the wood. In regard to gene-
ral management, few ligneam plenta require so little care as the willow, when
cultivated as timber or coppicewood3 but considerable care is requisite
where it is grown for hoops or roda for wiclerworlr.

eatam ο] Tace Willowr. Willow graves, or plantatione of the tree in
messes for the production of timber, ere best formed in low maist bonoim,
which, however, must be drained in such a manner as that the soil may
never become swurated with stagnant water. When planted in rows, or as
single trees, the most eligible situation for the willow is along the high
barrks of rivers, brooks, or ditches. Some sorts, and especially S. hlba and
S. Russellidua, me also be planted in upland soil in massea3 and S. ciprea
will succeed in codd, boggy, or marshy soil, if draiued; but neither this nor

growth, is to cut oli* all the shoots but the strongest one, which is leli to

trees. In felling willow trees when the barlr is an object, the trees may
either be harled standing, in the mouth of Mau, and cut down in the August
following ς or cut down in May, and disbarlred while lying on tha ground.
