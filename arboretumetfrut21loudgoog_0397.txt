clms, or limes. On the Continent, the nekedness os the trunks ol mad-side
trees is an objection rather than an advantage, on account of the superior
dryness ol the climate. ln the Nouocaa Coum d'Agn'caltare, it is recom-
mendcd to substitute white poplars, in old elm or oels avenues, for any trees
that may have died hom accident or disease, on account of the rapidity ol' its
owtb, and the short time which will be requisita for it to atteia au equal
eight with the elme or oalrs remaining.

Poetical, mythological, aad legendary Allraioae. According to the ancient
mythology, thawbite poplar was consecrated to Hercules, because he destroyed
Cacus ina cavera adjoining Mount Aventinus, which was covered with these
trees; and, in the moment of his triumph, bound his brows with a branch of
white poplar (that being the only uaenear him), as a token of his victory.

When he descended into t'he infernal regions, he also returned witha wreath '

of white popler round his head. (Staokh. Coram dc Theophrart„ p. 217.) lt was

the infernal regions turned the u per surlace ol the leaves almost black.
Persona otierin sacrifices to Herc es were always crowned with brauchas of
this tree; and l who had gloliously conquered their cnemies in battle wore
garlanda ol' it, in imitation of Hercules. The poeta hequently mention the
white poplar. Homer, when describis the shield of Ajax‚ son of Telamon,
states that it was made by Tychius, as ‘lful currier of Hyla; and it is said
that the Tychius thus immortalised was areal person, beneath the poplar trec
at whose door Homer had osten sat, reciting his poema, while tha kind·
hearted currier gave him food, and relieved his necessities. ln another part

Sterne, in his &summat Joamoey, represents Maria aa sitting under s poplar.
ln the Senticam <p Flowerr, it rs sard that the ancients consecrated this trec

to time, because t eleaves are iu continual agitation3 and, being of a blachish
green on one side, with a thick white cotton ou the other, they were supposed
to indicate the alternatiou oi day and night.

Soil, Situation, Prupagatioa, aad Crdtare. For the abele to attain a larga
size, the soil in which it is planted should be loamy, and near water; though
on a dry soil, where the tree will grow slower, the timber will be finer-grained,
and more durable. In France, it is found to grow, not only in marshy places,

, but in dry canday and itis a mistalre to suppose that it will thrive in stagnant

marshes in any climate. The French writers recommend it strongly for
arenues, planted at a distance of alst. tree from crea, ou the side os a road
from 6⁰ ft. to 100 it. wide3 and, sor filling up blanlrs in grown-u avenues,the
