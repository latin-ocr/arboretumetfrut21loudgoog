Britain from time immemorial; and ripening its fruit against vvnlls, in the

Vors‘etier. Botanicrdly, the common fig may be considered as existieg in three
different states :⁶- 1. Wild,in which the leaves are comparatively small, aud
not much cut; andtbe nuit smakand sometimes blus and sometimes white.
2. Cultivated, with very large leaves, very dee‘ply cut, such es the blue
ischia and the Brunswick tig, and other sorta; esruit ofaome oi which is
white,and ofothers dark. 3. Cultiveted,with very leaves,not much ent,
as the white Marseilles ,andothere with fruit of ' erent colonis. 'ibose
who are disposed to go her may form three aubvarieties under each od
these heads, according aa the fruit is blue or blank, rm or purple, or·
yellow, white, or green.

Description, dc. .The common figis alow, deciduous trec, rerely exceeding
20 n. in height ss a standard, even in the south of Europe; with large d ly
lobed leores, rough on the upper sursace, and pubescent beneoth. ehibe
branches are clothed with short aira, and the bark os the trunk rs greemsh.
The fig is a native of the west of Asia and the shores of the Mediterraneum,
both ιο Europe and Africa. ln no country is it found in elevated sitne·
tiona, or st a distance hom the sca. Hence its ebundance in tbe islanda ol
the Archipelago, and on the shores os the adjoining continents. lt hes been
cultivated from time immemoris} ς and, indeed, the fig sves said to have been
the first t'ruit eaten by man. ln the Bible, we read hequently of the lig trec,
both in the Old and New Testament. Among the Greeks, ve lind,by the
laws oi Lycurgus, thet figs formed apert ot* the ordinary sood os the Spartana.
The Atheniens were ao eboiee of their fige, that they did not allow them to be

recommends figs as being nutritive and restorative; and it appears srom him,
and other sument writers, that they were iven to proiessed championa end
wrestlers, to refresh and strengthen them. liny mentions six different kinds
of bg, enumerating tbe peculias qualities οι each.

Τ efirst fig trees planted in England ara said ιο have been brought from .
Italy in rste, in the reign of Henry Vlll, by cardinal Pole, and placed by
him against the walis of the archiepiscopal palere at Lambeth. ln Miller’e
