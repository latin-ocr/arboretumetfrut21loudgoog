of some others, live on the wood. The larva of the puss moth (esrum nula)

seldom seen‚aa it flies but little, and only during the night. The larva ol
Smerlnthus ocellhtus is common on willows nnd poplnrs from July to the end
of September, and the fly does not usually appear till the following spring.
lt is stated of this insect, that e female produced young without ha ' any
connexion with the male; from which ιι would appear that in certain epi-
ddptera a single pairing can render fertile more than one oration, as well
as in the case of the A‘phides. (Μ . Not. Eut, vitient. Trochllium api-
