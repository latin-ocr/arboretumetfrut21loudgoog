as growing from 20 lt. to 30 l't. high; end, though affected by frost, is yet
sufficienti hardy to be classed among ornamental trces of the third mdc.
lt is ily propegeted by luyers. For small gardens, and diminutive
arboretums, t is tree moy serve very well to exemplily the Jnglmrddeeoe.
(lere should be teken to trein it to a single stem, end not to pient it in
soil so rich and moist ns to prevent it from ripening its wood. Perhaps,
also, something might be gained in point of herdinees by grelting it upon
the common wulnut, either on the collar of the stock, m order to form
dwarf trees, or bushes ς or stendurd high, iu order to form trees thet would
from the firsthcve cleer straight meme, endas they would ri their wood
better, in consequence ol growing slower then low trees or ushes, so they
would perhaps show blossoms ond ripen fruit. Some yeers ago, Messrs.
Booth ol the Floetbeclr N urseries reintroduced this species into Britain ss
