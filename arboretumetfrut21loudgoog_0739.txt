abundant on the Apenninee, especially at Valombrcsa, and also between
Florence and Bologna, and we cannot help noficing a circumstance mentioned
by Sir T. D. lauder, as having struck him when ia Italy, and with which we
were ourselvcs very much pleased when therey via. that these chestnut trees
on the Α ennines are generally scattered over a surlace resembling the green-
sward ο a British lawn. According ιο Dr. R. Α. Philippi, castanea vesca
does not appear to be wild in any part ol Etna, but always to be cultivated.
‘⁸ We noticed it,” he says, “ on thesides of Mount Zoccolaro, at a height οἰ
3000 st.; and Gemmellaro is said to have traced it as high as steort, but
tbis is probablya mistake, aris' from an erroneous calculation of the altitude. =
On the south side of the ntpslnlre chestnut trees resch to 2500 n, and on the
Pyrenees ιο heddii. Etaa is celebrated for the great age and colossal dimen-
sione of its chestnut trees= the noted Castagno di Cento Cavalli has a cir-
cumferenoe near the root ol reon. 3 the Gastagno di Santa Agara, rosta and
the Gastsgno della Nave, 64 ft. Their sterne, however, attain no great height,
but soon branclr off above the ground ; and, in regard to the first-mentioned
one, it seems probable ιο me that not oue stem, but many, shoot from the
same root ς sor there are now 5 individual trunks separate from each other;
and it is a general eunom in Sicily, when these trees attaina diameter of about
llh, to cut them down just above the root, when a number of new shoots
are thrown out, which shortly become trees again. M. Brrmner is of the
same opiniones is stated in his Escarsr'oa through the East cs L' aria, Elbo,
Sicily, aad Mana” (See Coppa. ιο Βοι. Mag, vol. i. p. 90.) In orth Ame-
rica, the sweet chestnutis eund as lar as lat. 44⁰ n, iu New Hampshire;

where, however, it is less common thau in Connecticut, New Jersey‚ and
Pennsylvania. lt is most abundant in the mountainoue districts ol the Garo-
linas and ol Georgia, and abeunde on the cumberland Mountains, and in East

ffirtary. he sweet chestnut ie generally said ιο have been brought ιο
Europe by the Greeks, from Sardis, sn Asia lllinor, ahorn 504 n. c. twas
lirst called, in Greek, Sardianos Balanos, the Sardis nut; afterwards Dior
Balanos Lophuon, l'rom its being considered to bear some resemblance to the
walnut, except in the smoothness of its inner berk. The name ol Castanea was
given ιο ἰι from Kastanea, the name of a city in Pontus, in Λείας and also
of one in the Vale ol Tempe, near the river Peneusy in both which places
the chestnut grew in great abundance, being a native of the former locality‚
and having been first planted in Greece in the latter, whence it was sent,
in therei of Tiberius (lassante Rome. It is evidentthat the Romans
received t e chestnut from the Greeks, as they called it both Cmoenea and
· Glans Sardiana. Theophrastus mentions that, in hia dms, Mount 01 us
was nearly covered with chestaut trees; and Pliny enumeratas eight kinffipat

were known ιο the Romans in bis da . Pliny adds that chestnuts were ground
into meal, and made into breed, by the poor. These were of an inferior kind,
ιο which be gives the name ol popularet ,· and be adds that there was another
sort, which were nerally borled, aad which were called mnne. Hc like·

first skin of the nut is flexible3 but the second has ab teste in the mouth,
like the skin of the wslnut: therefore care should be taken ιο remove it.
Chestnuts are better roasted than ceolred in any other manner.” (Nat. Hert.)
One of the largest and oldest chestnut trees iu the world is that on lllouat
