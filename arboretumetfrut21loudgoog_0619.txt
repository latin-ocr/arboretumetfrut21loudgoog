he adds, used 101 the floors 01 outer eovemng 01 wooden houses, from its lia·
bility to warp and split. The wood 01 young trees is very elastic, and capable
01 such minure division, that it is used for many 01 the purposes 01 theivillow

aeats and baalis for chaire, the rims 01 sieves, the bottoms 01 riddles, and
caner’s whips‚ which are made iii the following manner :—“ A tapering pisce
of the wood is clest in nine, from the small eud to within l ft. of the other end,
which is let solid for the hand. These nine spleets are then twisted by threes,
and the threes again twisted together3 the whole is then sewed iii acase 01 blach
leather, and a silken thong added, which completas the whip.” (Birktecls’r
Noter,&c.,p.7l.) The woodisalso used, iii Americafor milli-pails,the bundles
ofaxes, aud numerous other rursl purposes. “ Of all tlie species,” says the
