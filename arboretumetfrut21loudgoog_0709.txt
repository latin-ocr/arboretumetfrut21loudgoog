was 0110011 surpaesin beauty, thet Passienus Crispus, a celebrated orator, who
was twice consul, and who alterwmde 11011100 the Empresa Agrip inawas so
1011110111, that he not only dalighted to heneath its sb e, but 110-
quently pouredwineon the roots,endusedo toembraceit.” Beechenciips
were used hythe latin sb he'rdsy and this cuatom is frequently alluded to
by the poeta. The oldest ritish writers on rursl affaire mention the beech
ss one 01 the four indigenous timber trees 01 England. Ita timber, however,
was considered inferior tothet 01 the three other timber trees, viz. the oali,
the aeli, and the elin. The mast 01 the beech has been, froin the earliest times,
valued as lood 10111110ος and, iii some parts 01 Bucliinghamshire, where tho
11000001ηά1, swine are still driven into the beech woods iu autumn. About
1721, Aaron Hill, the poet, proposed s scheme 101 paying 011 the nationsl
debt with the prolite 01 the oil ιο 110 mede hom beech nutat but his
scheme lell to the ground Other plane 101 making beech oil have been sug-
gested, but always without success. Indeed, it is probable that the mast
requires to beripened in awarmer climate then that 01 Britain ιο malie it

that, iii Sweden, scarcely any oil at all can be expressed froin it. The useful·

01 swina that they could support, together with the hcihty with which the
tree is raised from seed, must ave rendered it orie of the lirsttreeepropsgated
and planted by art. Accordingly, Gersrd, iii 1597, speaks 01 the excellent
effect which the nuts hed in fatteniiig swina, deer, and pigeons; aud Par-
liiueon, writing iii 1640, says thet the baech isplantediuparlia, l'orests, and
chases, to seed deer ς but, in other places, to latren swina, ‘⁶ whose lat,'’ he adde,
‘⁴ will be soher than theirs that are lattened with acorns.” The beauty 01 this
trec, the density 01 its shade, and the classical associatione connected with it,
independently altogether 01 the uses 01 111 lruit, occasioned it ιο be early
planted as an oruamental tree, both iri Britain and on the Continent. We
find both Evelyn snd Cocli recommending it 101 ehsdy wallis, awenues, aiid

much lnnted in Scotlsnd till between 1510 and 15603 and many 01 the trees
theri planted at Hopetoun Houiie, Arniston, luverary, and Newbattle, still
exist, and are the oldest iii the country. The beech was probably planted in
