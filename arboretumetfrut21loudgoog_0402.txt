and that oft 's species is thought better than any of the others. The greal
drawhsck to the tree, when planted siugl on lawns or pastores, or iu hedge·
rous, is the number of auchers which it throws u ς and which, il not caten
down by cattle, or moun, would soon turn a vdole country into an aspen
forest. Perhaps it might he on P.nlgra, which does not throw up
anchora, or possshly on some ind of willow.

Portical aad legendary Admiom. 'l'he constant 'vering of the as
leaves has rendered the treeafavourite sub' tof dl¹¹ ion to the medix
poeta, and others, who have wished to fin a comparisou for anything in
constant motion. One of the most curious superstitious respecting this tree
is that of the Highlandem, who believe that the crosa of Christ was made of
it, and that, cons uently, it can never rest. This, however, as ldlss Kent
observes, can har y apply to the leaves, ss the crosa could not havebeeu
made of them3 but aps, she adds, “they struggle to escape from the
wicked wood onwhic they grow.'' (SpL Slretckm, pel.) Gerard compares
the leaves to women’s tonpues,“whrch seldom oeasc wagingss’

Soil, desudanda As the roots of this tree chielly extend close undm
the surlace of the mouud, it is not necessary that the soil should be deep;
but, for the same reason, it ought to be loamy, rich rather thou poor, aud cou-
stantly moist. Hence, also, this trec ia better adapted for soils that are con-
atantly wet below, than almost any other trec, since rts roots, hy keeping so very
near the surface, are never out of the resch of the air, which they would be
ifthey netratedinto soil perpetually saturated with water. The conditione
whicht is tree requires in respect to soil are found in moist woods, where
the shade of the tree diminishes evaporation, and where the annual fall and
decay of the leaves prodpce a constant sup'pby of leaf-mould. The next
most favourable situatron rs an open morat m ow, iu which the tree, being
freely exposed to the light aad su on every side, attains its largest aize, and
assumes its fiuent form. ln dry soils, the tres will live for many years, but
never either attalus large siae, or display its foliage to advantage. When
planted iu messes lpp itsell', the trees may be placed at the distance from each
other of oh. ore . every way; and such a plantation, on a suitahle soil,
will have attained perfectron ιο 50 or 60 years, and may he cul down as
timber. After lelling, the shoots seldom push vigorously; but the abundant
auclara from the roots will roducea second crop of timber, if that should
be considered advisable. asa coppice-wood, it may be cut down
