(Smith Eng. miv. Aea.) 8. vite ⁸ n, strangely referred to S. silbons a
variety by the greio oller, differs from S. tlbs obviously in its longer, more
tuper catkinu lanceolnte, pointed bracteas; glabrous libamenta, and gla-
brous adult leaves, and,perhaps,in other merke (Soliti, incidentell · in ang.

As a shrub, it is not less so, both among evergreen shrubs arrd deciduous
kinds, having the hsrk of oonspiouous c'olours. ln the English garden at
Munich, extensive messes os this willow are placed in contrast with messes
of the white-berked honeysuckle (Lonicera Xyldsteum), the red-barked
dogvvood (Cornus tina), und the brown-barked spirea (S. opulildlie).
The outlines of the messes at Munich are lumpish and lonnal, and theone
mssa is by no menna blendcd with the other as it ought to be; but still the
effect, in the winter sesson, is very striking, and vell deserves imitation by
the landscape-gardeners of this country. 'l'he tree of thisspeciesin the ·
Horticultural Society's (iarden, which is a male, and e very handsome tree,
was sote high in 1835, aller having been only ten or tvelve years planted.
Both male and female plants are in the Hsckney arboretnm end at Wo-

burn Abbey.
