diest ol' European elms; and it has been found in the foreste near Soissonr,
and in some other parte ol France. The first botanist who mentioned this
tree was Pallas ; and, about the same time, it was described, st length, by Μ.
Fougeroux de Bondaroy, in the Mdmoirer de I'Acodimie der seleuce lor 1784.
Pallas states that the woodis very hard and durable, and thet it is used in
Russie sor all the purposes that the common elm is employed for in Europe.
Boudaroy says that this sort of elm is very common by the road side, between
Villars Cotterets and Paris; and also between that city and Cressy. lt
comcs into leaf 15 or 20 days before the remmon elm, and it owe much
faster. The headismore spreading than that of the commone 3and its
berk, instead of being furrowed,is smooth. On the whole, be says, the trees
are so diii'erent in their general e pearance, that they may be readily distin-
guished srorn each other, even without their leaves. The colour ol' the young
wood, the buds, and the srze, colom, and serrature ol the leaves, are re·
marhably like those ol' the Huntingdon elm3 from which circumstance this

dener, Mr. Ward, flowers, but does not ripen seeds, on which account it
would appear to he allied to U. campestris3 but, tho h its roote run very
near the sursece, rt never throws u a single eucher, arii hence it would seem
to belong rather to U. montius. ⁴¹'ere are plante at Mesers. Loddiges's.
