the only sex at present known to British botanists, assimilstes to the kinds
os the group Purpirreae, except S. rdbra Hudr, in the aspect os the branches,
shoots, leaves, and cathina ς rn some of the leaves being opposite; and in
the old barli being internally yellovv, though less remarlrebly so than that os
these kinds; but it differs from thern in having its leaves sillry beneath,
and its ovarystalked‚ and Mr. Borrer believes that, in the relation of
affinity, it is nearest to S. lhsca3 but he notices that we are without the
rneaus of proof, which the male llowers would allord. There are plante
