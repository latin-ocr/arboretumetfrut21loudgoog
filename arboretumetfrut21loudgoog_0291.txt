Η, ed. 2.) Sir W. l. Hoolter and Mr. Borrer have referred to this species
,several kinds as varieties, which bave been regarded as species by Smith
and others, and which we give below, retaining the specific character of
each, for tbe convenience of those who bnve received t ern aa species, and

plant '’ of Smitb “itself is usually a small procumbant shrub, with
¹rather long straight brancbes ; but varying exceedingly‚ according to
situation and other circumstances, as do the leaves also, which are
more or less glabrous above, and more or less silky beneath, where
the nerves are prominent.” (Id.) The brancbes are spreading,
brown, and downy, with fine close baira when young. psnrilh.) Catkins
generally appearing before the leaves. A very beauti ul little species,

Smith states ibat it is found w'itd in moist mduntainuus heatbs in
the nortb; that its time of flowering is Ma . In the salictum at
Woburn, it flowered in May, and again in July. The male plant is
figured in the English Botanp and the Safinium Weber-neme. There
are planta at Woburn Abbey,Henf1eld,sndFlitwick Honse.

except the small lesfy shoots of the present year, which are downy.
