why plantatione ot⁴ it will prove less profitable thau tlroseo other trees. ln
answm tethin it may be stated, let, that, as the oalr is almost in every case
planted among nurse trees, which are not cut down till they are ol' some salue
aa poles or timber, there can hardly ba said to be such a thing as a young oal

the timber of the oalr, even aben os small site, the velue ol the barli, aud, as
Mattbew observes, the slight comparative injurp of its shadeto coppice-wood,
hcdge-plants, grata corn, or other omps, “ sbou dgive a preference to this trec

For Hcdgemcu timber, it is agreed by most writers that the oalr is superior “
to all other trees. It produces tbs most valuable timber and barlt iu that
situation, and does less iujury to the hedge, and to the bea'oage or corn bc-

· neatb it, than any other species, unless, perhaps, as Mattbew observes, the
epple aad the pear be excepted ς besem the hericontei roots do not nan ,

near the surlace, and the buds come later into leaf thau those ol any other
British tree. The geneal torm, and the great variety of outline, os the

become brown, particulari in dry ground, performing the operation with thc
