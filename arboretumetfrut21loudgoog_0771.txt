When treated as a tree with a single stem, it will probably live much longer.
The l st nut trees which we recollect to have seen in England are in
Eastwe Park, Kent; where, drawn up among thorns, crab trees, and common
maplcs, tpp'y are uppards of 3011. high, with trunks lft. in diameter at the

Geogmplynghe hezel is a native os all the temperate climatcs of Europe
and Asia. ln Great Britain, it is found from Cornwall to Sutherlandshire:
in the north of England, it attains to the elevation of 1600ft. ( Winch); arrd
ht on the hille of Forfarshire and Abcrdeen-
shire. ( Watcon’r Outliner, tec.) ln Lochiel, Argyllshire, between 7001111111
soon. above the sca, there was, in 1832, a small wood ο1 nut trees, producing
abundante of fruit, and some of them with trunlcs of above 1 st. in circumfe-
rence. (Itu.) The line of nuts on the Alps, between 45⁰ and 46⁰, is stated by
H. (i. Watson to rise to stas ft, the snow line being 9080ft. ln Sweden,
according to Professor Schouw, the hazel is found on the west side of lle·
ligoland, in lat. 60⁰; while on the eastern side of the great mountain range
it reaches to lat 60-61⁰; and, though met with more to the northward,
in the Gulf of Bothnia, yet it does not there go beyond 63⁰. ln short, it is
considered as not extending beyond the region of the beech. (See Gaul. Mag,
xii. p. 60.) Evelyn observes that the hazel “affecta cold, barren, dry, and
sandy grounds3 monotaimus, and even rocliy, soils produce thcm3 they
prosper where quarries of frcestone lle underneath, as at Hazelbury in Wilt-
shire, Hazelinglield in Cambridgeshire, Hazelmcre in Surrey, and other places;
but more plentifully if the ground be somewhat maist, dankish, and mossy,
as in the fresher bottoms and sides of hills, holts, and in hedgerows.”
(Hunt. Erret, i. p. 215.) ln Kent, where the hezel abounds in all the native
woods, and where the cultivated varieties are to bc found in most urchards,
