brown, yellow‚ and silvery touches, which are peculiarly picturesque, as they
are characteristic objecta of imitation for the pencil, and as they contrast
agreeably with the darh green hue of the foliage. But only the stem and
larger branches have this varied colouring. Thes rayis of a deep brown, which

be experienced by those who have seen the trec in its native habitata. Natives
of Scotland, North Wales, Sweden, Russia, and Germany would regard the
birch as indicating poor, sandy‚ boggy, or rocky soil; and would not place
it on a lawu3 from the same feelings that would prevent a London lenter
from placing there the elder, or arry of the common willows. ln e gar-
denesque style, therefore, or in that species of picturesque which is an
imitation of nature, and not an identification of her scenery‚ the birch‚iu most
parts of Europe, would require to be planted in situations where it would not

general view. The same principle applica in the case of every iudigenous tree ;
