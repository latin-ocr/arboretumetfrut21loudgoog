berry that the coeoons of the srlkwonn have so much more tenacity of libre
than those ot* any other intect that sceda on the leaves ol trees. Hence, also,
the silk, like the tobacco and the wine, of warm climates, and of poor
dry toda is always superior ιο that produced in colder climatea, and from
rich and moist soils. The fruit ol some of the varieties, particularly of M.
a. multicaulia, is used sor making rohs and symps; and is said to he remark-
ably good to eat3 lor which reason this variety, in warrn climatea, might he
introduced into urchards. The hark, according to Rosier, may be convened
into linen ol the fineness of silk. “ For thia purpose, the young wood is ga-
thaad in August, during the uacent os the second sap, and nnmersed for three
or four da m still water. lt is then taken out, attsunstet, spread on the
grase returned to the water at suanae. Thra rs darly ted; and,

The hark is alto used, like that os the lime tree, lor making best sor mats.

ol Europe, the white mulberry is grown in plantatione hy itseli'¹ like willows
and l'ruit trees; also in hedgerows, and es hedges; but in all cases the planta

off the leaves is osten repeated a second time the same year; but, in France
