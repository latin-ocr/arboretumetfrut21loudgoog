either gamenssque, or ffiresque, according to the character of the scene in
which they are to be p . Aa gardenesque objecta, all the abraba, as well
as the trees, will have most effect when nained to a single stem, if only to the

respect to willows in general, which always convey the ides ol the vicinity ol
water, or of marshy ground.

ASedelnm is the only scene in which a complete collection of willows can
be displayed to advantage ς because, aa we have already observed, willows are
not trees that will macciate well with any other kinds. We wouldb no
means recommend a salictum to he formed along the margin of water where
the planta can be seen only on one side; unless, indeed, the object were to form
picmresque acenery. ln this case, the planta maybe grouped in various wa ·s;
some on the margin of water, others on the open lawn, and some on rocks,
banka, and stony laces. A salictum where the objectis to preserve as much
aa possible tha inriigenons characters ol the kinds, ought to contain various
entheas and kinds oi soil; and be wholly aquatic in some places, aud rocky,

velly, aandy, or arid, in others. Such a salictum is admirably ada ted sor

a salictmn ol this kind would be a scene particularly suitable lor the
northol Scotland. Agardenesque salictum is that which would produce
most effect in a fertile and level country; and, il water is at command, it may
either be conducted in draim under the sursace, for the purpose of irrigation
pt pleasure3 or it may appear in a eanal, surrounding'the salictum, and assum·
