They are therefore well adapted for the arboretam, and for indicating water,
or meist situations, hut not for general use in ornamental plantatione. Where-

Willows in general, Gilpin observes, are trees of a straggling ramification, and

terite a marthy country; or to mark, in a second distance, the wiudiug baalisv
of a heavy, low, sunlr river; which could ιιοι otherwise be noticed’' Some
species, he says, he has admired; aud he particularitas the S. filba, as having
a “ pleasant, li ht, sea-green tint, which mixes agreeably with foliage of a
deeper hue.” y far the most beautiful willow, when in flower, is S. caprea,
the cathina of which are not only lar r than those of every other species,
but produced in greater abuudance. 1 erice the great beauty of thia willow
in early aprin , and its importance as fnrniahing food to bees. “Itis in
llower,” says r. Wallrer, speaking with reference to the climate of Edin-
burgh, “between the lbth of March and the 8th of April. During this
time, whenever the thermomcter is at or about 42⁰ in the shade, accompanied
with aunshine, the bees come abroad. This is a temperatura which often
occura; and, if bees have an opportunity, during that interval, of feeding
three or four days upon this willow, the hive will he preserved, when, without
this, it would probably periah.''

Aa a curioua use of the willow, it is mentioned in the h'oaneau Da Homel,
that the roota are more recdily changed into branchos, and the brancbes into
roots, than in any other species of a tree. All thetis necessary is, to calce up
