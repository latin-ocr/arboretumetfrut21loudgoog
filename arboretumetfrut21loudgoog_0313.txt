serrated‚ with half-heartshaped stipulas, strongly serrated, or toothed‚ vari-
ous in aize, but never very large.” According to Smith, S⁴ cinerea is the least
useful of the sallows3 but its branches, when two years old,are used for
banda and coarse wickerwork. There are planta at Woburn, Flitwick, and .
in the Hackney arboretam.

Varietics. There are several varieties of this species, one ol which has va-
riegated leaves ; and, as this is a rare character among willows, it merite a
distinct notice. Smith, in his English Flora, iv. p. 216.‚notices having re·
celveda specimen of such a variety froin Germany. ΜΓ. Forbes has since
found twoplants with slightly vari ted leaves,growing in the Wohurn

the leaves, which are also much broader, and of a drinner texture. lue
branches, or twigs, are very brittle, and not adaptcd to any economical pur-
pose, except that, perhaps, of being used for fire-wood.
