ln E land, formerly, Evelyn informs us, “there were considerable plant-
ations o this tres, particularly on the chalk hills ol Surrey.'' He instances
those ol Sir Richard Stidolph, near Leatherhead; Sir Robert Clayton, at
Morden, near Godstone, once belonging to Sir John Evelyn; und the country
about Carshalton. During thalete war, great numbers os walnut trees,
iu differem parts ol England, were cut down for the purpose ol supplying
gun-stocks3 till the price of walnut timber rose so hig (6001. having been
gisen lor one large treey, aa to induce its importation lrom the Continent,
and the substitution o the wood os the back walnut ol America. ln

the esent day, when mahogany and other tropical woods are substi-
tu for walnut wood by the cabinet-maheru, arrd when wood for gun„

stocksis imported hom t e Black Sea, and also from North America, the
prolits attending the culture of the common walnut trae are greatly dimi-
uished; and it rs, accordingly much less generally planted as a timber tree.
ns a fruit tree, its planting is, perhaps, on the increase ; the improved varieties
becorm better known. ln North Americe, the European walnut has been
planted or its fnrit3 aud Michaux recommends it to be budded on the black
saluum but, as the wood of the former is considered as being far misrior to
that ol the latter, he does not recommend its introduction into the United
state as a forest tree. Welnuts sor the table are now annually imported from
France arrd Spain; and pay a duty ol 21. per bushel. The quantity imported
in 1831 was 23ρἵ bushels, of which 160 bushels were exported, and the
runainder retained for home use. In 1832, only about two thirds ol the
fflffll were imported3 but ⁵⁵¹. bushels were exported. (MCullocl'r Canem.

Evelyn strongly recommends walnut timber for household lurniture, utensile,
and wainscotrng wells, “instead ol the more vulgar beech, subject to be weak
