Elm, was raised in Smith’a Numery, at Worcester, Mr. Smith
states, in 1810, from seeds obtained srom atree in Nottinghomshire.
ΜΓ. Kaight of Downton Castle purchased some of these trees;
and one os them turned out to be that weeping variety which
bas since obtained tlie name of the Downton elm. On writing to
ΜΓ. Smith, to endeavour to t some information respecting the
trees that produced the seed, einlorms us in answer, that, aller
making every enquiry in Nottinghnmahire respecting thece trees, he
finds “ they were a mixture ol' ,wych and English: nobably they
were all planted aa Engliab; but, being ted trees, aad being planted
by the sade os a public road, they nug t have been broken offat the

“the Downton elm is more remarkable for the singularityof ita

form an'd gvowth, than for its velue as a timber tree.” There ia a tree

ol this variety in the Horticultural Society’s (iarden 23 h. high, the
