they are attached. liny speaks oi three kinds of poplar: the blech, the
wh1te, aad tbe poplar of Libya. Hc mentions that the poplar was cultivated,
as a prop ta the vine (Plio, lib. xvi. cap. 23. and ca .37.); aud that the
πω were lanted in quincunx, in arder that they mi ih obtain more light
aud air. lie also says that the-wood of the paplar, hie that of the willaw,
aad of all the aquatic trees, rs particularly surtable for making bucklers,
from its lightness; and because, when struck, the hlow only indents
the sofl wood, without pierciag or cracking it. The poplar buckler
thus acted like a ahield oi lndian rabber, or any other elastic substance,
aad repelled the blow. The ancieuts applied the leaves of the paplar,
macerated in vinegar, to parts affected by the gout3 and they dried the
young shoots with the leaves on during summer, and laid them b , to
serve as winter food for cattle. The wood of the lar is soit, iight,
aad generally white, or os a pale yellow. It is but of iiiia use in the arta,
exceptio some departments of cabinet and toy makrn ,and sor boarded floors3
for which last purpose it is well adapted, from its w teneas, and the sacility
with which it is scoured; andalao, rom the difficulty with which it catchss
lire, aad the slowness with which it buras. ln these respecta, it is the very
reverse of deal. Poplar, like other solt woods, is generally considered not
durable; but this is onl the case when it is exposed to the external atmo-

oi several oi the exotio kinds of poplar have never been introduced into

when they are planted in a more cangeuial situation; but the timber, in dry
soils,is said ta he more compact, fiaegrained, aad durable. P. alba and
its varieties produce their leaves much earlier than P. nigra aad its varteties.
